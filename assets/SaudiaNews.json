Kijchai Enterprise, a Thailand-based manufacturer of wood-based panels. This is the second PV system that TotalEnergies ENEOS has installed for the company within 4 years and the first floating solar PV system for TotalEnergies ENEOS in Asia Pacific. With over 3,000 modules installed, the solar PV system generates approximately 2,650 megawatt-hours (MWh) of renewable electricity annually. This results in a reduction in the company's overall carbon footprint by approximately 1,125 tons of CO2 emissions, equivalent to planting around 16,800 trees. Under a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), TotalEnergies ENEOS fully funded, installed, and will operate the solar system for the next 12 years. With no upfront investment required, S. Kijchai Enterprise will only pay for the cost of electricity generated during the tenure, leading to significant cost savings for the company. S.
