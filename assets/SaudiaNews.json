The acclaimed restaurant was distinguished with the recognition in three distinct categories, including Most Romantic Ambience in Asia, Outstanding Architecture in Asia, and Best Innovative Dining Concept in Vietnam. This sweeping victory underscores the foundational philosophy of Smith's Kitchen & Bar, which meticulously crafted with steel curves and bespoke details that adorn the Smith's architectural space are a testament to the blacksmith's legacy of transforming raw metal into works of art. The Smith's dining experience reflects that essence of life, which is celebrating art and tradition, at the same time enduring beauty of finely crafted simplicity. The double recognitions of Most Romantic Ambience in Asia and Outstanding Architecture in Asia, are profound acknowledgments of the venue's masterful design execution. At Smith's Kitchen & Bar, we believe there are striking similarities between a blacksmith's forge and a chef's kitchen, both requiring a deep understanding of materials, mastery of skill, and dedication to perfection. The Smith's brand, a vital and dynamic asset to the Silverland Hospitality Group, is a tribute to the talented local artisans who have created innovative ironwork that not only makes the space architecturally unique, but also embodies the spirit of creativity and dedication that has defined us over the years.

The restaurant is meticulously crafted to ensure that guests not only savor great and innovative meals, but that the exquisite design and atmosphere elevate their entire experience to a realm of polished sophistication. Smith's Kitchen & Bar: Where innovative cuisine meets award-winning design The momentum generated at the Luxury Restaurant Awards is built upon a solid foundation of international recognition established throughout the 2025 calendar year. Smith's Kitchen & Bar has consistently been celebrated for its design prowess on both local and international stage.
