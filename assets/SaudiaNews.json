This initiative reinforces Singapore's position as a global model of religious cohesion through insightful and impactful research, community engagement, and academic leadership. [Left] Prof Alan Chan, SMU Provost and Dr Tan Choon Kim, Chairman, Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple [Right] As interfaith dialogue adapts to evolving challenges, from global geopolitical shifts to changing religious affiliations among younger generations, the Professorship will play a pivotal role in shaping research, education, and policy conversations around inter-religious understanding. The inaugural holder of this prestigious Professorship is Professor Alan Chan, SMU Provost, who will lead efforts to deepen interfaith dialogue, educate future leaders on religious diversity, and collaborate with scholars, policymakers, and community leaders. Under his guidance, SMU will spearhead research-driven solutions that address contemporary inter-religious issues. A Step in Strengthening Religious Harmony Singapore's social fabric has long been underpinned by strong interfaith relations and multiracial cohesion, but these foundations require active effort to sustain. The Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple Chair Professorship will focus on: Advancing Research and Education \u2013 Deepen our understanding of religious diversity, inter-faith dialogue, and harmony through rigorous academic study. Community Engagement \u2013 Educate students, nurture future leaders in inter-religious harmony, and foster deeper connections among diverse faith and cultural communities through outreach efforts such as public forums and collaborations with different religious organisations. The initiative will be embedded within SMU's Cultures of the Modern World basket under the Core Curriculum, ensuring that SMU's undergraduate students are equipped with a nuanced understanding of religious diversity. \"I am deeply honoured to have been conferred this Chair Professorship. The generous support of the Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple will contribute significantly to fostering understanding and mutual respect across faiths, which helps build cohesive communities and is especially relevant to multi-cultural and multi-religious Singapore. I look very much forward to engaging our students and promoting scholarship and dialogue in inter-religious studies and harmony,\"\" said Professor Alan Chan, SMU Provost. Professor Alan Chan will also deliver an annual public lecture series, fostering dialogue among scholars, government agencies, and community leaders on pressing issues in inter-religious relations. Supporting Students in Need Beyond academia, Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple is extending its commitment to education with an additional S$1 million towards the Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple Bursary. This builds on its earlier S$1 million gift in 2015 to support underprivileged students at SMU. Starting from Academic Year 2025/2026, the enhanced bursary will provide four annual awards of S$8,300 each, covering tuition and study-related expenses for up to four years. This funding ensures that deserving Singaporean and Singapore Permanent Resident students can pursue their education without financial constraints. A Heritage of Impactful Philanthropy Established in 1884, Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple has been a pillar of philanthropy in Singapore, supporting education, healthcare, and social welfare. This latest gift to SMU reflects its enduring dedication to fostering a more inclusive and compassionate society. SMU President Professor Lily Kong expressed appreciation for the Temple's generosity: \"I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple for their unwavering generosity and belief in the power of education. This gift strengthens SMU's role in advancing inter-religious understanding, not only by empowering students but also by supporting faculty in pioneering research and shaping knowledge that contributes to both Singapore and the world. Through rigorous scholarship and meaningful engagement, we will continue to foster dialogue, expand perspectives, and drive impactful change.\" Dr Tan Choon Kim, Chairman, Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple added: \"Education is central to society. By advancing inter-religious studies and supporting students in need, we hope to contribute to a more united and understanding society. SMU's commitment to academic excellence and its dedication to nurturing socially responsible leaders align with our values, making it a natural partner for this endeavour.\" About Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple (\u89c2\u97f3\u5802\u4f5b\u7956\u5e99) is a traditional Chinese Buddhist temple situated at 178 Waterloo Street in Singapore.
