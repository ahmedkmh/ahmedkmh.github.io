(\"Kyocera\") to scale the manufacturing of its proprietary electrochemical cells to support rapid commercial deployments of Utility's H2Gen\u00ae systems, enabling economic industrial decarbonization of hard-to-abate industries such as steel, refining, petrochemicals and chemicals. Utility Global and Kyocera Join Forces to Scale H2Gen\u00ae Manufacturing Globally for Economic Industrial Decarbonization Under the partnership, Utility's proprietary ceramic-metal electrochemical cell technology will be combined with Kyocera's world-class advanced materials capabilities and diversified global manufacturing footprint. Together, the companies will expand cell manufacturing capacity, enable efficiencies, and accelerate time-to-market for H2Gen systems. \"Kyocera is one of the most respected advanced materials manufacturers in the world, and this collaboration marks a pivotal milestone in bringing our proprietary electrochemical cell technology to market faster and at global scale,\" said Parker Meeks, President and Chief Executive Officer of Utility Global. \"By pairing our breakthrough materials technology and ceramic-metal manufacturing and coating know-how with Kyocera's proven manufacturing excellence and global presence, particularly in the regions of high interest to Utility, we can jointly meet our accelerating demand for H2Gen systems.\" The partnership includes the establishment of high-volume production lines, shared collaboration in advanced materials engineering and automation, and joint quality and durability testing to meet the high standards of Utility's global heavy industry customers, who are committed to reducing emissions of their products and operations so long as it does not negatively affect their core economics, which H2Gen achieves. Utility and Kyocera plan to initially establish a dedicated manufacturing hub at Kyocera's Fine Ceramics manufacturing facility in Hendersonville, North Carolina, with initial production capacity operational in 2026. Further additional manufacturing capabilities are expected to expand globally in sync with the demand for Utility's industrial-scale projects. \"The collaboration between our two companies will make this partnership a rapid success and provide high performance, high quality electrochemical cells for Utility,\" stated Jeff Osmun, Vice President of Kyocera International, Inc., Fine Ceramics Group. \"As a global leader and producer of advanced engineered ceramic materials and components, we are seeking to leverage our existing and future capabilities to help enable carbon neutralization. This is in line with Kyocera's philosophy, which aims to solve social issues through its business activities and realize a sustainable society. Partnering with Utility is another major step in that direction.\" This Agreement builds on Utility's recent commercial momentum and further positions the company as one of the most advanced, disruptive and economic industrial decarbonization companies providing two core products for its customers: namely, clean hydrogen that can be utilized as low-to-negative carbon energy, fuel or feedstock, alongside high purity carbon dioxide (including over 95% pure CO2 in refining and petrochemical applications) completely reshaping the cost and footprint of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). Utility's patented H2Gen technology produces clean hydrogen from water by harnessing electrochemical energy from existing industrial processes' off-gases without electricity \u2014eliminating the need for electricity and new grid infrastructure, hence dramatically lowering hydrogen production costs in addition to producing a separate high purity CO2 stream. This unique economic decarbonization value proposition has driven significant commercial traction for Utility in heavy industry globally with steel as a lead sector, including a recently announced project with ArcelorMittal in Brazil, where blast furnace off-gas will be utilized to decarbonize integrated steelmaking. Blast furnace-based steel production accounts for over 70% of steel produced globally today and over 85% of steel industry emissions, presenting a significant market opportunity for economic decarbonization. Utility's commercialization strategy in teaming up with established global manufacturers like Kyocera further strengthens supply chain resilience, enhances product reliability, and supports rapid project deployments across multiple continents and markets. Scalable H2Gen manufacturing and project execution aligns well with major global trends in decarbonizing heavy industries, requiring economic competitiveness in both small-scale projects as well as modular and scalable deployments at industrial scale, with Utility's modular H2Gen technology ready to deliver with active customer projects in development at both ends of that project spectrum. About Utility Global Utility delivers practical solutions that drive economic industrial decarbonization across industries such as steel, mobility, refining, chemicals, and upstream oil & gas. The company's breakthrough H2Gen\u00ae technology harnesses energy from industrial off-gases and biogases to produce application-specific high-purity, low-to-negative carbon intensity hydrogen on-site from water, without electricity, using its proprietary electrochemical process. H2Gen also produces a high-concentration carbon dioxide stream, which can eliminate or reduce the cost of carbon capture. H2Gen systems are modular, scalable, and operationally flexible, integrating seamlessly into existing hard-to-abate industrial assets with a record small footprint, enabling practical, economic decarbonization.

The Road Ahead With Chery: What Australians Know (And Don't Know) About Hybrid & Electric Vehicles \u2013 based on a national survey of 2,010 prospective Aussie car buyers commissioned by Chery Australia \u2013 found that while 3 in 4 Australians (74%) would consider a New Energy Vehicle (NEV), more than half (53%) say they are not confident in distinguishing between hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles. Understanding different types of New Electric Vehicles The report shows that nearly 1 in 4 Australians (23%) say their next car will be a hybrid, while a further 1 in 5 (21%) intend to buy another type of NEV, including plug-in hybrids (7%) or fully electric vehicles (7%). Younger Australians are leading the interest in cleaner cars, even if affordability keeps many of them in petrol vehicles for now. Almost 9 in 10 Gen Z drivers (87%) would consider a NEV, yet 48% still expect their next car to be petrol-powered. This group also shows the highest confidence in driving longer distances in hybrid or electric cars. Among them, Gen Z drivers in Sydney stand out as the most engaged nationally, with 40% saying they are very likely to consider owning a NEV. \"Australians clearly want smarter, more efficient cars but many are still wading through jargon,\" said Lucas Harris, Chief Operating Officer, Chery Australia. \"Our job is to make hybrid technology simple and accessible so families can choose with confidence. Younger drivers are curious and environmentally aware; they just need clarity, not complexity.\" Knowledge gaps remain across the market The research highlights a clear need for education to support the transition to new energy technology, with confidence levels differing greatly by gender. Nearly 2 in 3 women (64%) say they are not confident understanding hybrid and electric models, compared with 2 in 5 men (41%). Among those who lack confidence, the top reasons include limited experience with the vehicles (39%), confusing acronyms (31%) and feeling unfamiliar with the technology (33%). When choosing their next vehicle, Australians focus on practical considerations. Cost and value rank highest (50%), followed by reliability (38%) and fuel efficiency (36%). Among those open to New Energy Vehicles, purchase cost (58%), battery charging time (38%) and driving range (34%) are the most important factors. Confidence in hybrids continues to grow Australians are more confident taking a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) on long road trips than fully electric vehicles, with 55% feeling confident compared with 46% for fully electric vehicles. When asked what would help build their confidence, 63% said longer battery range, 60% called for more charging stations/better infrastructure and 38% said a better understanding of vehicle capabilities. Australians associate NEVs most strongly with lower running and fuel costs (82%), reduced emissions (57%) and a quiet, smoother drive (52%). These perceptions point to an emerging awareness of the practical and environmental benefits of hybrids, even as range and affordability remain front of mind. \"This research reinforces that Australians want affordable innovation.\" said Harris. \"Australians are ready to make the switch, but they need clear information and real-world reassurance. Chery commissioned this report to better understand the challenges and barriers consumers face, so we can help tackle them head on through education and by introducing vehicles that genuinely meet the needs of Australian drivers.\" About the research The Road Ahead with Chery: What Australians Know (and Don't Know) about Hybrid & Electric Vehicles Survey (n = 2,010), was conducted by independent consumer research agency MYMAVINS, nationally among Australians intending to purchase a car within the next three years. The sample was balanced by age, gender and region to reflect the national population. \u2013 ENDS \u2013 About Chery Chery Australia is a leading automotive brand recognised globally for its commitment to innovation, style, and performance.
