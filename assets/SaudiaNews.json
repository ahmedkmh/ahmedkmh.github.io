This collaboration aims to strengthen the region's logistics ecosystem by integrating BBTruck's supply chain platform with Haulio's container haulage services, enhancing logistics efficiency across both long- and short-haul routes. BBTruck and Haulio Partner to Deliver Seamless, End-to-End Supply Chain Logistics from Sea to Shore BBTruck provides a one-stop B2B supply chain logistics technology platform, enabling precise capacity calculations and resource allocation, optimizing logistics management. Haulio, Singapore's largest B2B truck transportation digital platform, focuses on matching port container transport for port operators, trucking companies, and customers. Haulio currently collaborates with about 90% of Singapore's container logistics companies. By integrating with Haulio's platform, BBTruck will automate fleet assignments upon container arrival, minimizing empty trips and delivering enhanced supply chain logistics management. This partnership also marks BBTruck's expansion into Southeast Asia, opening new market opportunities for its customers. BBTruck and Haulio Deliver Seamless Transport From Sea to Shore, Enhancing Global Logistics and Supply Chain Efficiency International maritime shipping plays a critical role in global trade, accounting for about 85% of global commerce, with an annual compound growth rate of over 5%. As Southeast Asia emerges as a key logistics hub, the demand for streamlined supply chains is increasing. A Forbes Insights report highlights that two-thirds of logistics companies see \"technological innovation\" as key to productivity and performance. \"As international maritime shipping continues to thrive, container throughput at ports will inevitably increase. We are very optimistic about the global growth potential of major commercial ports in Southeast Asia,\" said Steven Chou, CEO and co-founder of BBTruck. \"The majority of traditional logistics companies worldwide still rely too heavily on communicating with ports with paper and phones, manually arranging transport and routes, and keeping manual records after containers successfully reach port. We are happy to partner with Haulio to help traditional logistics providers address the long-standing pain points of fragmented and hard-to-integrate information, thereby enhancing global companies' international trade competitiveness and supply chain management flexibility.\" BBTruck Integrates Haulio's Container Haulage Platform To Optimize Both Long and Short Supply Chain Logistics Journeys BBTruck creates a transparent supply chain logistics management platform for businesses and logistics providers, integrating key data on various truck sizes, equipment, real-time orders, carrying capacity, and addresses to significantly reduce logistics costs and delivery times. Through the integration of Haulio's \"Haulio Connectivity System,\" which matches port container transport, BBTruck will deepen its presence in existing markets including Taiwan and North America while officially expanding into the Southeast Asia market for maritime container logistics services, building a comprehensive world-class logistics ecosystem. With Haulio's technology enhancing international shipping container data integration, fleet management, and matching, BBTruck's global customers will be able to match available trucks for container transport as soon as containers arrive at the delivery port, using BBTruck's supply chain and logistics technology platform. From port to final destination, BBTruck will offer a convenient API integration interface and comprehensive data exchange framework, enabling full monitoring of capacity data and tracking of shipment status and routes, providing businesses with a seamless, more efficient logistics journey that covers both sea and land transportation. \"The logistics industry is at the heart of global trade and key supply chains, and the role of the Southeast Asian market is becoming increasingly important, said Alvin Ea, Co-Founder and CEO of Haulio. \"Haulio has long focused on the Singapore and Southeast Asian markets, and through our automated container haulage platform, traditional container transport companies can improve their transport efficiency. BBTruck's vision of revolutionizing supply chain logistics through technology aligns perfectly with our core values. This strategic partnership marks a new milestone in realizing seamless connectivity between ocean and land transport. We believe this will lead more global supply chain and logistics companies toward successful digital transformation.\" Through this strategic partnership, BBTruck will accelerate its expansion into Southeast Asian markets, including Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Building on Haulio's years of market presence and operational capacity in Southeast Asia, BBTruck will establish local transport fleets and partner ecosystems, providing global customers with more efficient and transparent logistics services.
