(Courtesy of Lunit) The original ScreenTrustCAD trial (2021\u20132022), published in The Lancet Digital Health, was the first prospective interventional study to demonstrate that AI could match or even surpass traditional two-radiologist systems. Building on these findings, the hospital fully integrated AI in mid-2023 and became the first in the world to implement AI as an independent reader, fully replacing one radiologist. The new analysis compares screening performance before and after AI adoption, offering real-world validation of Lunit INSIGHT MMG's clinical and operational benefits. Real-World Results: Efficiency Gains and Enhanced Screening Metrics The follow-up study analyzed screening metrics from two nine-month periods: July 2018\u2013March 2019 (pre-AI / pre-COVID) and July 2023\u2013March 2024 (post-AI implementation). Key findings include: 11% Decrease in Recall Rates: Recall rates dropped from 2.8% to 2.5%, minimizing unnecessary follow-ups for patients. Fewer False Positives: The rate of false positives decreased significantly from 89.6% to 78.0%, reflecting a notable improvement in screening accuracy. Improved Positive Predictive Values (PPV): The PPV for recalls increased to 22.1% with AI, compared to 16.9% without AI, indicating fewer unnecessary recalls and a more efficient screening process. Increased Cancer Detection Rates: Cancer detection rates increased by 15%, rising from 4.8 (traditional double reading) to 5.5 per 1,000 screened (with AI). Reduced Overall Reading Time: Reading time decreased by over 36%, enabling radiologists to allocate more time to complex cases and other critical tasks. These findings demonstrate AI's ability to enhance diagnostic accuracy and significantly improve screening efficiency. Pioneering AI Integration in Breast Screening The adoption of Lunit INSIGHT MMG at Capio S:t Go\u0308ran Hospital marks a global milestone in AI-driven healthcare. By replacing one human reader, the AI system addresses the growing radiologist shortage while maintaining the rigor of double-reading protocols.

Is China building an \"anti-America circle\" by actively participating in global governance? The answer is NO. The world is faced with varying complexities, with challenges posed to peace and development. Humanity is again standing at the crossroads of history, facing the question of which path to take. As the second largest economy in the world, China has long been a player on the international stage, with vivid global features. As a member of the global community of shared future, China has been an active participant in the international governance, which is in line with the real needs of the country's development, but also an act of shouldering responsibilities as a major country. Rather than building such circles, what has China done? It is the second largest contributor to both peacekeeping assessment and the largest troop-contributing country (TCC) among the permanent members of the UN Security Council. It has actively collaborated with other countries in tackling climate change, and driving the transformation of relevant industries; it has been an active mediator of regional and international hot-button issues, helping Iran and Saudi Arabia broker an agreement in Beijing; China has been an active provider of humanitarian aid, for example, the juncao project has brought hope to African countries and island countries on the Pacific in addressing hunger and poverty.
