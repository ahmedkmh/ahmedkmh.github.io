SYDNEY, Dec. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- For the millions of Australians living with asthma or seasonal allergies, summer isn't just about making the most of long, sunny days. It also marks the height of hay fever season, and in Southern Australia, the drier climate during late spring and summer significantly amplifies the risk of bushfires. Coway Airmega Air Purifier Series With allergy and asthma symptoms often peaking at this time of year, many Australians are turning to air purifiers as an effective way to keep the air in their homes clean. By capturing airborne pollen, allergens and other irritants, air purifiers help create more comfortable indoor environments. Coway, South Korea's leading wellness tech company, announced today that their Airmega 350, 100 and 50 models have been newly recognised under the Sensitive Choice program by the National Asthma Council Australia. Products carrying the Sensitive Choice logo have been assessed and approved by the National Asthma Council Australia for their potential to improve the lives of people with asthma or allergies. Four of Coway's Airmega models \u2013 the Airmega Mighty and the Airmega 150, 250 and 400 \u2013 have already received approval from the Sensitive Choice program, and this latest addition of three further models serves to strengthen Coway's commitment to providing Australians with a wide range of options geared towards healthier indoor living. The Airmega models to most recently receive approval under the Sensitive Choice program provide options for a wide range of room sizes and air purification needs: Airmega 350: Ideal for large areas such as offices and commercial spaces, the Airmega 350 purifies spaces up to 182m2 in size in just 60 minutes. Its aerodynamic blades deliver high-volume airflow through controlled vortices for stablised, efficient performance. Airmega 100: A compact, cylindrical model with 360\u00b0 air intake, the Airmega 100 can clean the air in a 63m2 space once every hour. Weighing only 3kg and standing just 39.5cm tall, it is ideal for apartments, bedrooms, nurseries and similar smaller living spaces. Airmega 50: Small yet powerful, the Airmega 50 is equipped with a full 360\u00b0 filtration system capable of serving rooms up to 31 m2 in size in just one hour. The most compact model in the series, weighing just 1.6 kg and standing 32 cm tall, it can easily be moved between rooms. All three models are equipped with Coway's proprietary 3-stage HEPA filtration system capable of removing 99.999% of nano-sized particles down to 0.01 microns \u2013 smaller than most allergens, bacteria, mould and pollen \u2013 and efficiently reducing smoke and other unpleasant odours for healthier and fresher indoor air. Additional features and functionalities of Coway's Airmega models include: Real-Time Air Quality Indicator (AQI): A colour-coded display that provides users with easy oversight of their indoor air quality. Smart Auto & Sleep Mode: Smart Auto Mode automatically adjusts airflow based on air quality, while Sleep Mode ensures lower noise and reduced lighting for undisturbed rest. Easy Maintenance: A convenient indicator reminds users when it's time to replace filters. Touchscreen Control: The control panel provides quick access to key functions such as the timer, night light and child lock.

LG Display unveils world's first 240Hz RGB stripe OLED panel The RGB stripe structure arranges the three primary color subpixels \u2014 red, green, and blue \u2014 in a straight line, significantly reducing visual distortions such as color bleeding and fringing, even at close viewing distances. Although OLED panels using the RGB stripe method existed before, their maximum refresh rate reached around 60Hz, making them unsuitable for use as gaming monitors. LG Display's new panel is the first in the world to achieve a 240Hz refresh rate while maintaining an RGB stripe structure. It incorporates the company's specialized Dynamic Frequency & Resolution (DFR) technology, allowing users to directly switch between high-resolution (UHD 240Hz) and high-refresh-rate (FHD 480Hz) modes. This product's high refresh rate not only delivers optimal performance in first-person shooter (FPS) games and other applications that require rapid screen transitions, but it is also optimized for operating systems such as Windows and for font-rendering engines, ensuring excellent text readability and high color accuracy. Featuring a high pixel density of 160 pixels per inch (ppi), this panel additionally provides exceptional detail and precision. With its plan to initially introduce the new pixel structure in its high-end gaming and professional monitor panels, LG Display will actively promote the technology at the upcoming CES 2026 as part of its strategy to expand its customer base and product lineup. Existing high-end Gaming OLED monitor panels have primarily used RGWB structures, which include a white subpixel, or configurations where RGB pixels are arranged in a triangular pattern. As LG Display developed its new pattern optimized for monitor use, it applied various new technologies \u2014 such as increasing the aperture ratio, which is the proportion of the pixel area that emits light. As a result, it achieved the world first of implementing both an RGB stripe structure and a high refresh rate simultaneously. The company is actively targeting the high-end monitor market, mass-producing about 30% of the panels for the OLED monitor global market. In particular, among Gaming OLED panels currently in mass production, LG Display holds the world's top titles in all major specs \u2014 including highest refresh rate, response time, and resolution \u2014 affirming its overwhelming technological leadership. \"Technology is the foundation of leadership in the rapidly growing OLED monitor market,\" said Lee Hyun-woo, Head of the Large Display Business Unit at LG Display. He added, \"We will continue to strengthen our global leadership by focusing on differentiated technologies compared to competitors, technologies that customers want, and technologies with strong business potential.\" About LG Display LG Display Co., Ltd. [NYSE: LPL, KRX: 034220] is the world's leading innovator of display technologies, including thin-film transistor liquid crystal and OLED displays. The company manufactures display panels in a broad range of sizes and specifications primarily for use in TVs, notebook computers, desktop monitors, automobiles, and various other applications, including tablets and mobile devices.
