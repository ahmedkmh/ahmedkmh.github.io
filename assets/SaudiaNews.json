The album aims to support growth for plants of all kinds - from houseplants that improve the living room air quality to trees that help make the planet greener. For every stream of the album, Califia will plant a tree through support of environmental non-profit tree planting charity One Tree Planted.* With more than 70% of Australian households owning at least one houseplant - equating to over 10.7 million homes - Australians have a deep-rooted love for greenery. The 2023 Great Australian Plant Survey reveals that more than 25% of respondents own between 11 and 20 plants, reflecting the growing enthusiasm for indoor gardening This passion is echoed in the nursery industry, where production nurseries sold an estimated 2.3 billion plants worth $3.6 billion in 2022. Research also suggests that plants respond positively to sound. Dr. Dominique Hes, head researcher at Plant Life Balance from the University of Melbourne, explains that plants thrive when exposed to music with frequencies between 115Hz and 250Hz. By combining soothing soundscapes with positive affirmations, The Green Album creates the ideal environment to support plant growth and well-being. O'Dowd also stars in Califia's 2025 ad campaign, \"Good Talks,\" celebrating the Irresistible Goodness of plants. \"At Califia Farms, we are absolutely obsessed with celebrating the goodness of plants, from their power to nourish us through delicious plant-based milks and creamers, to the joy they bring into our homes, to their positive impact on the health of our planet,\" said Suzanne Ginestro, chief marketing officer of Califia Farms. \"The Green Album by Califia Farms goes beyond positive plant affirmations - it's a compilation of feel-good tracks to reinforce well-being for both plants and people. Chris was the perfect partner to bring our passion for plants to life in a joyful, fun and calming way, and our collaboration with One Tree Planted reflects our commitment to fostering a more sustainable world.\" Rooted in nourishing tracks like \"Branch Scan\" and \"Seeding Self Love,\" the soothing affirmations gently encourage plants, and people, to take time to, \"root yourself into the ground, stretch those limbs towards the sky and find that center\u2014your brightness\u2014and remember to hold on to it throughout your day.\" The album is an ideal way for both humans and plants to start their day, offering a peaceful moment to enjoy a morning coffee \u2013 with plant-based creamer \u2013 while nurturing our green companions. All tracks can be streamed on Spotify now. Recognising the power of plants to restore our environment, Califia will plant a tree with One Tree Planted for every stream of The Green Album on Spotify, with the goal of planting 25,000 trees in areas that need them most, supporting vital reforestation efforts. Listeners can feel good about making the world a greener place, for their houseplants and the planet, with every listen. \"Our new Green Album hopes to help plants, and indeed; people, feel grounded enough to grow. And each stream helps plant a tree, so give it a listen to make the world a greener, better place.\" said Chris O'Dowd. O'Dowd also stars in Califia's 2025 ad campaign, \"Good Talks,\" which celebrates the Irresistible Goodness of plants. The projects were developed with Goodby Silverstein & Partners (GS&P) and will be airing throughout the year across social, digital and streaming.
