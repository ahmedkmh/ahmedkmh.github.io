This remarkable event, Make Waves for Hong Kong, aims to raise HK$3.5 million to provide learn to swim lessons for thousands of adults and children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Organised for the third consecutive year by charity, Splash Foundation, the event highlights a commitment to ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to learn to swim and enjoy the benefits of being in the water. The 45 km relay swim begins at Sandy Bay and circumnavigates clockwise around Hong Kong Island. Four Hong Kong teams will be vying for position alongside a Singapore team. The swimmers represent diverse backgrounds and swim levels, united by their motivation to share the joy of swimming with others. Amongst the Hong Kong teams are Ryan Leung, the first Hong Konger to conquer the North Channel - one of the world's toughest swims; Janis Mok, Outreach and Strategic Partnerships Manager of the Swire Institute of Marine Science, the University of Hong Kong's research facility at Hong Kong's only marine reserve; and Vada Chung, Founder of Whiskers N Paws, who began open water swimming just two years ago. Nearly Half of Hong Kong is Unable to SwimDespite having the longest coastline of any city and an abundance of swimming pools, around half of Hong Kongers, mostly women and children from low-income communities, are unable to swim. The beneficiary of the event, Splash Foundation is a charity dedicated to improving access to swimming for disadvantaged children and adults. Their programmes are free-of-cost to learners across the city and see an 80% success rate at the end of 20 hours of instruction. Learning to Swim for Individual and Community WellbeingRyan Leung, Senior US Consultant at True North Education, is looking forward to swimming in his home city, \"In the most challenging parts of my North Channel swim, the only way I could keep going was by adopting a mindset to focus on what I can control and accept what I couldn't. Swimming Make Waves and expanding access to learning to swim means giving Hong Kong disadvantaged youth this tool to navigate the immense pressures they're often under, build resilience and learn that they can achieve what may seem impossible at first.\" Janis Mok's career change from the finance sector into marine conservation is closely tied to her journey into open water swimming. \"In Hong Kong, we have a pronounced terrestrial bias; what we don't see, we don't care about. I grew up as a competitive swimmer, primarily in pools, until I finally took the chance to embrace what I didn't know. Hong Kong's waters have been improving and become clearer and cleaner due to measures taken by the government in early 2010s. To continue this progress, Hong Kong needs to learn to swim, learn to love the water, and see for themselves all that is worth saving.\" Vada Chung, \"I never realised that just a swimsuit, goggles and a swim cap could bring so much joy. I want others to discover that same joy which is why I'm swimming Make Waves. When I first swam out of the shark nets 2 years ago, I experienced something truly transformative - it was both exhilarating and strangely grounding at the same time. The swim connected my mind and breath to nature. Everything came together and I was hooked. I'm excited to help more people experience the joy swimming has given me.\" Lasting ImpactMake Waves for Hong Kong funds nearly half of Splash Foundation's annual learn to swim programmes, enabling thousands of kids and adults from disadvantaged communities to experience the transformative impact of learning to swim and to enjoy lifelong access to the water.
