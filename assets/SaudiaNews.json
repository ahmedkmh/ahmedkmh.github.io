(\"Youdao\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: DAO), an AI-powered solutions provider specializing in artificial intelligence applications for the learning and advertising verticals, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025. Third Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights Total net revenues were RMB1,628.5 million (US$228.8 million), representing a 3.6% increase from the same period in 2024.- Net revenues from learning services were RMB643.1 million (US$90.3 million), representing a 16.2% decrease from the same period in 2024.- Net revenues from smart devices were RMB245.8 million (US$34.5 million), representing a 22.1% decrease from the same period in 2024.- Net revenues from online marketing services were RMB739.7 million (US$103.9 million), representing a 51.1% increase from the same period in 2024. Gross margin was 42.2%, compared with 50.2% for the same period in 2024. Income from operations was RMB28.3 million (US$4.0 million), representing a 73.7% decrease from the same period in 2024. Basic and diluted net income per American depositary share (\"ADS\") attributable to ordinary shareholders were near zero, compared with RMB0.74 for the same period of 2024. Non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per ADS attributable to ordinary shareholders were RMB0.08 (US$0.01), compared with RMB0.76 for the same period of 2024. \"We continued to advance our AI-Native Strategy in the third quarter, strengthening our technological capabilities and translating innovation into meaningful user and business value. Building on the solid operating profit in the first half of the year, we strategically increased investments in Youdao Lingshi and our online marketing services to unlock their long-term growth potential. Youdao Lingshi expanded its customer acquisition channels, driving over 40% year-over-year growth in gross billings. Our online marketing services accelerated, with net revenues rising 51.1% year-over-year to a record RMB739.7 million, fueled by strong demand from the NetEase group and overseas markets. In addition, total sales of AI-driven subscription services also reached a new high of approximately RMB100 million in the third quarter, representing over 40% year-over-year growth, supported by ongoing upgrades to existing applications and the rollout of new ones,\" said Dr. Feng Zhou, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Youdao. \"Looking ahead, we will continue executing on our AI-Native Strategy, deepening the application of and innovating with our large language model, Confucius, across both our learning and advertising businesses to consistently create customer value. Financially, we remain confident in meeting our full-year targets, delivering strong year-over-year improvements in operating profit and achieving annual operating cash-flow breakeven for the first time,\" Dr. Zhou concluded. Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results Net Revenues Net revenues for the third quarter of 2025 were RMB1,628.5 million (US$228.8 million), representing a 3.6% increase from RMB1,572.5 million for the same period of 2024. Net revenues from learning services were RMB643.1 million (US$90.3 million) for the third quarter of 2025, representing a 16.2% decrease from RMB767.9 million for the same period of 2024. The year-over-year decrease was mainly because we continued to take a disciplined, strategic approach to customer acquisition, which places greater emphasis on higher ROI (return on investment) engagements. We believe this strategy has enhanced the overall resilience and operational efficiency of our business, despite the short-term revenue decline. Net revenues from smart devices were RMB245.8 million (US$34.5 million) for the third quarter of 2025, representing a 22.1% decrease from RMB315.3 million for the same period of 2024, primarily due to the declined demands of smart learning devices in the third quarter of 2025. Net revenues from online marketing services were RMB739.7 million (US$103.9 million) for the third quarter of 2025, representing a 51.1% increase from RMB489.4 million for the same period of 2024. The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to the increased demands from the NetEase group and overseas markets, which was driven by our continued investments in AI technology. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit for the third quarter of 2025 was RMB687.9 million (US$96.6 million), representing a 12.9% decrease from RMB789.5 million for the same period of 2024. Gross margin was 42.2% for the third quarter of 2025, compared with 50.2% for the same period of 2024. The decrease was mainly due to the declined gross profit margin of online marketing services. Gross margin for learning services was 58.5% for the third quarter of 2025, compared with 62.1% for the same period of 2024. The decrease was mainly due to the decline in economies of scale as a result of the decreased revenues from learning services. Gross margin for smart devices increased to 50.3% for the third quarter of 2025 from 42.8% for the same period of 2024. The improvement was mainly attributable to the higher gross margin arising from the newly launched Youdao Dictionary Pen in 2025. Gross margin for online marketing services was 25.4% for the third quarter of 2025, compared with 36.3% for the same period of 2024. The decrease was mainly attributable to our strategic expansion of our client base for advertising services. As the collaboration with new clients remains in its nascent stage, the gross margin for these clients holds potential for future improvement. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2025 were RMB659.6 million (US$92.7 million), compared with RMB682.2 million for the same period of last year. Sales and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2025 were RMB487.7 million (US$68.5 million), representing a decrease of 6.1% from RMB519.6 million for the same period of 2024. This decrease was attributable to the reduced marketing expenditures in learning services and smart devices in the third quarter of 2025. Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2025 were RMB127.8 million (US$18.0 million), representing an increase of 6.9% from RMB119.6 million for the same period of 2024. The increase was primarily due to the increased headcount for research and development employees in online marketing services, leading to higher payroll-related expenses in the third quarter of 2025. General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2025 were RMB44.1 million (US$6.2 million), kept flat the same period of 2024. Income from Operations As a result of the foregoing, income from operations for the third quarter of 2025 was RMB28.3 million (US$4.0 million), representing a 73.7% decrease from RMB107.3 million for the same period in 2024. The margin of income from operations was 1.7%, compared with 6.8% for the same period of last year. Net Income Attributable to Youdao's Ordinary Shareholders Net income attributable to Youdao's ordinary shareholders for the third quarter of 2025 was RMB0.1 million (US$0.0 million), compared with RMB86.3 million for the same period of last year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Youdao's ordinary shareholders for the third quarter of 2025 was RMB9.2 million (US$1.3 million), compared with RMB88.7 million for the same period of last year. Basic and diluted net income per ADS attributable to ordinary shareholders for the third quarter of 2025 was near zero, compared with RMB0.74 for the same period of 2024. Non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per ADS attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB0.08 (US$0.01), compared with RMB0.76 for the same period of 2024. Other Information As of September 30, 2025, Youdao's cash, cash equivalents, current and non-current restricted cash, and short-term investments totaled RMB557.7 million (US$78.3 million), compared with RMB662.6 million as of December 31, 2024. For the third quarter of 2025, net cash used in operating activities was RMB58.6 million (US$8.2 million). Youdao's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on management's ability to implement an effective business plan amid a changing regulatory environment, generate operating cash flows, and secure external financing for future development. To support Youdao's future business, NetEase Group has agreed to provide financial support for ongoing operations in the next thirty-six months starting from May 2024. As of September 30, 2025, Youdao has received various forms of financial support from the NetEase Group, including, among others, RMB878.0 million in short-term loan, and US$131.1 million in long-term loans maturing on March 31, 2027 drawn from the US$300.0 million revolving loan facility. As of September 30, 2025, the Company's contract liabilities, which mainly consisted of deferred revenues generated from Youdao's learning services, were RMB751.1 million (US$105.5 million), compared with RMB961.0 million as of December 31, 2024. Share Repurchase Program On November 17, 2022, the Company announced that its board of directors had authorized the Company to adopt a share repurchase program in accordance with applicable laws and regulations for up to US$20 million of its Class A ordinary shares (including in the form of ADSs) during a period of up to 36 months beginning on November 18, 2022.

As of September 30, 2025, the Company had repurchased a total of approximately 7.5 million ADSs for a total consideration of approximately US$33.8 million in the open market under the share repurchase program.

Youdao, Inc. (NYSE: DAO) is strategically positioned as an AI-powered solutions provider specializing in artificial intelligence applications for the learning and advertising verticals. Youdao mainly offers learning services, online marketing services and smart devices \u2013 all powered by advanced technologies. Youdao was founded in 2006 as part of NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTES; HKEX: 9999), a leading internet technology company in China. For more information, please visit: http://ir.youdao.com. Non-GAAP Measures Youdao considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income/(loss) per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). Youdao defines non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders as net income/(loss) attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses, impairment of long-term investments, gain from fair value change of long-term investment and adjustment for GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling item for the income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders enables Youdao's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of these items, which are non-cash charges in nature. Youdao believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, which possibly do not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures Youdao uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures uses by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" set forth at the end of this release. The accompanying table has more details on the reconciliation between our GAAP financial measures that are mostly directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures. Youdao encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

Net revenues from games and related value-added services were RMB23.3 billion (US$3.3 billion) for the third quarter of 2025, compared with RMB22.8 billion and RMB20.9 billion for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024, respectively. Net revenues from the operation of online games accounted for approximately 97.6% of the segment's net revenues for the third quarter of 2025, compared with 97.1% and 96.8% for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter increase in online games net revenues was due to higher net revenues from self-developed games such as Fantasy Westward Journey Online and Sword of Justice, as well as certain licensed games. The year-over-year increase was attributable to higher net revenues from self-developed games such as Fantasy Westward Journey Online, Eggy Party and newly-launched Where Winds Meet and Marvel Rivals, as well as certain licensed games. Net revenues from Youdao were RMB1.6 billion (US$228.8 million) for the third quarter of 2025, compared with RMB1.4 billion and RMB1.6 billion for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024.

Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were RMB1.4 billion (US$202.1 million) for the third quarter of 2025, compared with RMB1.7 billion and RMB1.8 billion for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024, respectively. Results from this segment were mainly driven by net revenues from Yanxuan, advertising services and other value-added services, as well as certain inter-segment transaction eliminations. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was led by decreased net revenues from Yanxuan. The year-over-year decrease reflected an increase in certain inter-segment transaction elimination and, to a lesser extent, decreased net revenues from Yanxuan and certain other businesses.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases were primarily due to increased marketing expenditures related to online games. Other Income/(Expenses) Other income/(expenses) consisted of investment income, interest income, net exchange losses/(gains) and others. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to fair value changes of equity security investments in the third quarter of 2025.

These statements are made under the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as \"will,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates\" and similar expressions. In addition, statements that are not historical facts, including statements about NetEase's strategies and business plans, its expectations regarding the growth of its business and its revenue and the quotations from management in this announcement are or contain forward-looking statements. NetEase may also make forward-looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), in announcements made on the website of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the \"Hong Kong Stock Exchange\"), in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online games market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its position in that market in China or globally; risks associated with NetEase's business and operating strategies and its ability to implement such strategies; NetEase's ability to develop and manage its operations and business; competition for, among other things, capital, technology and skilled personnel; potential changes in regulatory environment in the markets where NetEase operates; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services or that NetEase will not be able to set, or follow in a timely manner, trends in the market; risks related to evolving economic cycles and geopolitical tensions, including the direct or indirect impacts of national trade, investment, protectionist, tax or other laws or policies as well as export controls and economic or trade sanctions; risks related to the expansion of NetEase's businesses and operations internationally; risks associated with cybersecurity threats or incidents; and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could adversely affect NetEase's business and financial results. Further information regarding these and other risks is included in NetEase's filings with the SEC and announcements on the website of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under applicable law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per ADS and per share, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders as net income attributable to the Company's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders enables NetEase's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses. NetEase believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase's business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. See the unaudited reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results at the end of this announcement. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

Technologies (FEET) provides up to 100% upfront financing for retrofits and introduces a pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism linked directly to verified fuel and regulatory savings By offering unsecured leases on retrofits, FEET decouples retrofit financing from vessel mortgages Through a blended financing structure and a diversified project portfolio, FEET balances financial risk while keeping financing costs competitive SINGAPORE, Nov. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD), AIM Horizon Investments and their partners today announced the successful closing of the Fund for Energy Efficiency Technologies (FEET), securing total commitments of up to USD 35M, exceeding its initial target. As the world's first fund for vessel retrofits leveraging a pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism, FEET directly addresses the long-standing financial barriers hindering the sector's uptake of vessel retrofits. This fund has drawn strong interest from across the maritime value chain, including equipment manufacturers, shipowners, and investors. GCMD provides catalytic equity and is FEET's appointed decarbonisation advisor. FEET is managed by AIM Horizon Investments. Formerly known as FPG AIM Capital, AIM Horizon Investments is a Singapore-based fund manager specialising in maritime and aviation funds for institutional and accredited investors. Shareholders of AIM Horizon Investments hold the fund's commercial equity position, while the Development Bank of Japan Inc. (DBJ) holds the preferred equity position. DBS Bank and ING (which acted as Coordinating Bank) have in principle agreed to provide senior debt financing. Scaling EET adoption to reduce emissions Improving energy efficiency remains one of the most effective strategies to reduce emissions and fuel costs. Energy Efficiency Technologies (EETs), such as wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS)[1] and air lubrication systems (ALS)[2], can deliver immediate fuel savings, assisting shipowners to stay competitive amid tightening regional carbon regulations. However, even with a retrofit market valued at over USD 20B, uncertainties around EET performance and access to financing continue to limit uptake. A primary difficulty restricting adoption is the inherently variable fuel savings from EET retrofits, which depend on operational and environmental factors, such as routing and weather conditions. The lack of standardised methodologies to accurately measure fuel savings further challenges uptake. This uncertainty has made the return on investment period difficult to predict and has exacerbated the split-incentive issue, where shipowners are expected to invest in retrofits whereas charterers realise savings. Verified savings at the core of pay-as-you-save A pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism addresses payback uncertainty with EETs by directly linking repayment to quantified and verified fuel and regulatory savings. Deploying this mechanism requires robust data collection and analysis to isolate the retrofit's contribution to overall fuel savings. To this end, GCMD has undertaken EET performance pilots, equipping vessels with additional sensors to acquire high-precision, high-resolution data and applying rigorous data analytics to quantify fuel savings with statistical confidence. As more data is collected across diverse operating and environmental conditions, these datasets can be used to model and predict savings under varying scenarios. Unsecured financing solution to accelerate EET uptake Commercial vessels are typically financed through loans which have a first priority mortgage over the vessel. As the cost of EETs is small relative to the vessel's value, it is not practical for shipowners or the existing secured financiers to provide vessel security to prospective retrofit financiers. Consequently, unsecured financing solutions are needed to accelerate the uptake of EETs. FEET decouples retrofit financing from vessel mortgages by offering unsecured leases. Under this structure, FEET provides up to 100% financing for the equipment and associated installation and sensorisation costs, and leases the hardware to shipowners. In return, shipowners make repayments linked directly to verified fuel and regulatory savings. At the end of the lease, ownership of the EET is transferred to the shipowner for a nominal fee. Blended financing and project diversification to manage risks A blend of catalytic capital, commercial and preferred equities, as well as senior debt, allows FEET to balance financial risk while keeping financing costs competitive. By investing in a diverse portfolio of projects across technologies, manufacturers, vessel owners and types, FEET spreads investment exposure across its portfolio and enhances fund resilience. Several projects have already been identified and have progressed to the final investment decision stage, reflecting strong industry interest and confidence. The fund remains open to shipowners and ship operators seeking support for adopting EETs. Poised for scale FEET is designed to scale beyond this initial closing, recognising the vast market size and shipping sector's pressing decarbonisation needs. GCMD and AIM Horizon Investments are targeting to scale the fund to USD 500M by 2030, capable of supporting around 200 ships. Scaling FEET will create a virtuous cycle: as the fund grows in size and its projects diversify, financing costs will decrease, and richer performance data on EET will be generated. This, in turn, will spur further innovation and deliver greater benefits for shipping companies, investors and EET manufacturers. Professor Lynn Loo, CEO, GCMD, said, \"Bringing FEET to life has taken persistence and a willingness from everyone involved to step into the unknown. There was no playbook; our teams were learning as we went. This is exactly the kind of collaborative, problem-solving mindset needed to move the needle on maritime decarbonisation. My hope is that FEET will accelerate the uptake of shipboard energy efficiency solutions and help unlock the scale of action needed to turn the industry's decarbonisation ambition into tangible progress.\" Michiel Muller, Partner AIM Horizon & FPG AIM, said, \"We are proud to work in this partnership and bring an innovative financial product for maritime decarbonisation. It has taken a huge collective effort to create a solution that immediately reduces carbon emissions and has competitive economics that will enable it to really scale. In GCMD we have found a like-minded partner whose professional and scientific approach impressed us since the start, and it was an opportunity to further expand our long-standing relationships with DBJ, ING and DBS Bank.\" Corporate Finance Department, Division 4, DBJ, said, \"We believe that the adoption of EETs is an effective solution for maritime decarbonisation. FEET provides a platform to support this, and DBJ has decided to invest in the fund. We are proud to be involved in such an international and ambitious initiative, and we sincerely hope that FEET's efforts will expand and contribute to the decarbonisation of the maritime industry.\" Stephen Fewster, Global Head of Shipping, ING, said, \"At ING we aim to put sustainability at the heart of what we do. We are therefore delighted and honoured to have collaborated with GCMD and our partners to drive the adoption of energy efficiency retrofits which are key for shipping's decarbonisation. We look forward to further cooperation with GCMD and scaling this innovative solution to accelerate the industry's transition to Net Zero.\" Max Lim, Managing Director and Group Head, Shipping, Aviation, Logistics & Transportation, DBS, said, \"Shipping is the lifeblood of global trade \u2013 moving about 80% of all goods across the world. At the same time, the sector accounts for about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Decarbonising this industry represents both a major challenge and a compelling opportunity. The FEET initiative not only supports the adoption of technologies for energy efficiency, but also seeks to help shipowners manage financial and climate risks. DBS is proud to be a partner in this pioneering effort that endeavours to make the transition to cleaner shipping both commercially viable and scalable.\" About the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD) was established as a non-profit organisation on 1 August 2021 with a mission to support the decarbonisation of the maritime industry by shaping standards, deploying solutions, financing projects, and fostering collaboration across sectors.
