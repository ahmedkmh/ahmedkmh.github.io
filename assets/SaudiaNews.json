Prysmian\u2019s fully stocked warehouse, ready to deliver connectivity and energy solutions that empower the region\u2019s progress With five decades of continuous operations in Singapore, Prysmian's long-standing presence reflects a deep understanding of regional infrastructure needs\u2014ranging from power grids and renewable energy systems to digital networks, transport, and urban developments. AI Data Centres Driving Structural Demand The rapid growth of AI data centres is reshaping infrastructure demand globally. These facilities require significantly higher power capacity, advanced digital connectivity, and robust thermal performance. Meanwhile, the scarcity of key raw materials, particularly copper\u2014is exerting sustained pressure on supply chains and component costs. This surge extends to the broader technology ecosystem, where prices of key computer components\u2014such as solid-state drives and graphics processing units\u2014have risen by up to 30 percent, largely driven by AI-related demand. Against this backdrop, infrastructure solutions must not only deliver superior performance but also optimize material usage and long-term sustainability. Engineering Innovation for Sustainable Performance Responding to these challenges, Prysmian continues to advance cable technology that balances performance, efficiency, and environmental impact. Most recently, the company also introduced in Southeast Asia a new power cable design that allows us to deliver the same power as conventional cables while using less copper and featuring a smaller overall diameter. This innovation, already successfully adopted in major data centres in other regions by Prysmian, is made possible through advanced optimisation of insulation and sheathing materials, allowing the cable to safely operate at temperatures up to 110 degrees Celsius compared to the industry norm of 90 degrees Celsius. Key benefits include: Reduced copper usage, resulting in a lower carbon footprint during production Lower overall cost, addressing market pressure from rising material prices Lighter weight, enabling more efficient transportation and reduced emissions Smaller bending radius, allowing easier installation, reduced space requirements, and faster deployment These features directly support long-term, sustainable infrastructure development, particularly in data centres, power networks, and high-density urban environments. Sustaining Leadership in Energy and Digital Infrastructure Backed by its global scale\u2014107 plants, 27 R&D centres, more than 33,000 employees, and over \u20ac17 billion in revenues in 2024\u2014Prysmian continues to support Asia Pacific's infrastructure growth with proven expertise and innovation. Singapore remains a key business and distribution hub for the Group, supporting customers across the region with advanced, high-performance cable solutions. Prysmian is also contributing to regional clean energy ambitions, including early-stage engineering and feasibility work on cross-border power connectivity projects. Sustainability as a Long-Term Imperative Prysmian's innovation strategy is closely aligned with its sustainability commitments. The company aims for 55 percent of its revenue to come from sustainable products and solutions by 2028 and has committed to achieving Net Zero across its operations and value chain by 2035. Recent global recognitions\u2014including inclusion in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook 2025 and ranking among TIME Magazine's World's Most Sustainable Companies\u2014underscore Prysmian's progress in embedding sustainability into both technology development and operational excellence. Looking Ahead As infrastructure demand continues to intensify, Prysmian remains focused on delivering solutions that are not only reliable and future-ready but also designed for long-term environmental and economic sustainability. With decades of experience in Singapore and across Asia Pacific, the company continues to invest in innovation, local capabilities, and partnerships to support the region's next phase of energy and digital transformation.

Elliott's analysis showed the Company's intrinsic net asset value to be more than \u00a526,000 per share as of January 16, 2026 \u2013 almost 40% above the Revised TOB price. Elliott's presentation also outlined the Standalone Plan for Toyota Industries, which offers a far more compelling option for shareholders than the Revised TOB. The Standalone Plan \u2013 including full cross-shareholding unwind and operational improvements \u2013 offers a clear path to an intrinsic net asset value of more than \u00a540,000 per share by 2028, representing more than 120% upside to the Revised TOB price. The presentation described the significant deficiencies in the transaction governance process and noted that if the Revised TOB succeeds, it would represent a setback for Japan's corporate governance reforms and dampen investor interest in the Japanese market. Elliott does not intend to tender its shares into the Revised TOB at the current terms and strongly encourages other shareholders not to tender.
