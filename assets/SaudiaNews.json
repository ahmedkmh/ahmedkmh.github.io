(\"MGI\"), a company dedicated to developing essential tools and technologies to drive innovation in the life sciences, has entered into a strategic partnership with Eva Holding Group, a Brazilian group operating in genomics applied to human health, animal health, and agribusiness. The initiative aims to expand Brazilian patients' access to genomics, including joint efforts in the development of the country's genetic sector. DNBSEQ-T7 The agreement includes the installation of genetic sequencers that expand public access to cutting-edge genomic technologies and enhance the accuracy of cancer disease tracking, such as the DNBSEQ-T7, a high-performance system that has already been used in Brazil's largest genomic sequencing project. This is the first T7 with IVD (In Vitro Diagnostic) certification sold in Latin America and the first and only IVDI-certified high throughput equipment in Brazil, meaning that, for the first time, the country has access to this technology for clinical use, in addition to its previous use for research. \"The DNBSEQ-T7 is a high-performance sequencer that combines large processing capacity with flexibility for multiple applications, including whole-genome, exome, and transcriptome sequencing. Its DNBSEQTM technology delivers high-quality data at low cost,\" says Carlos Carpio, Senior Commercial Director for MGI Latin America and General Manager of MGI in Brazil. With its high performance, the DNBSEQ-T7 enables the resolution of complex genomic structures and the filling of gaps in genome assemblies, delivering deeper and more continuous DNA analysis. This technology contributes to the generation of more comprehensive data, improves the final quality of genome assemblies, supports accurate variant detection, and provides a broader view of the genetic profile. Eva Holding Group comprises four brands focused on different segments, all with DNA as a central tool: - Predictus Gene \u2013 focused on human predictive analysis through whole genome sequencing (WGS). - OLLIN \u2013 dedicated to the clinical diagnosis of rare diseases. - Pet Nex \u2013 specialized in genetic analysis for pets. - Earth Biome \u2013 focused on genomics applied to livestock and agriculture. \"MGI is now our main partner in bringing cutting-edge genetic sequencing technology. This collaboration represents another important step in innovation with real impact, especially benefiting oncology patients, rare diseases, and neonatal screening, through the 72-hour Genome,\" state Dr. Rene Pimenta da Silva Junior, CEO of OLLIN Ana\u0301lises Geno\u0302micas, and Dr. Carolina A. Barbosa, President of Eva Holding Group. As part of its strategy, the group will centralize its high-complexity genomic operations in a technology park, ensuring greater efficiency, quality control, and scalability in its projects. Genetic sequencing: an ally of precision medicine Genetic sequencing plays a critical role in screening for various types of cancer, helping to identify genes associated with disease development. With a higher level of precision, doctors can recommend more effective and personalized treatments, leading to better clinical outcomes and increased patient survival rates. Moreover, in cases of hereditary cancer where there is a genetic predisposition to disease development, technology can support predictive medicine and enable preventive measures. \"Understanding the risks of certain diseases enables the adoption of more assertive prevention strategies, as well as the comparison of therapeutic options to select those with the highest likelihood of a positive response, based on each patient's genetic history,\" concludes Carlos Carpio.

Ltd. (AnnJi, TWSE: 7754) today announced that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track Designation for AJ201, the first-in-class for therapy for spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, also known as Kennedy's disease). \"Receiving the Fast Track Designation for AJ201 marks a significant milestone for AnnJi,\" said Dr. Wendy Huang, CEO and Chairperson of the Board of AnnJi. \"Alongside the Orphan Drug Designations granted by both the U.S. FDA and EMA, this recognition reinforces AJ201's potential to address the unmet needs of patients with SBMA. Backed by a strong global patent portfolio, we remain committed to advancing AJ201 into Phase 3 development and to working closely with the FDA to potentially deliver the first approved treatment for SBMA in more than two decades.\" About SBMA and AJ201 SBMA, or Kennedy's disease, is a rare X-linked inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. The resulting mutant AR protein contributes to muscle and neuron degeneration through mechanisms involving cellular toxicity, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. SBMA affects ~1 in 40,000 males globally and currently has no FDA-approved treatment. AJ201, also known as JM17, is a novel investigational compound that has shown potential in reducing mutant AR toxicity and improving motor function in preclinical SBMA models. At the molecular level, it promotes degradation of pathogenic mAR protein, induces expression of antioxidant enzymes, proteasome subunits, and heat shock proteins, all of which may slow disease progression (Bott et al., 2016). About AnnJi Pharmaceutical AnnJi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (TWSE: 7754) is a clinical-stage drug development company focused on the development of innovative small molecules (NCEs). The company is dedicated to addressing high unmet medical needs in the fields of neurology, dermatology, and immune-inflammatory diseases, including rare diseases, such as Kennedy's disease (SBMA) and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). AnnJi is committed to develop innovative therapies that improve the quality of life for patients suffering from neglected chronic diseases. We focus on advancing high-quality, differentiated, and innovative drug candidates, and collaborating with global pharmaceutical partners. Upon achieving proof-of-concept in phase II clinical trials, we aim to out-license our products for further co-development and commercialization, with the goal of bringing them to global markets and driving sustainable growth for the company.
