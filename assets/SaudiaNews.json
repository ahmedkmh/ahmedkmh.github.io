EBRT is a widely used and validated treatment suitable for most solid malignant tumors. This treatment is typically delivered by radiation oncologists who play a central role in managing cancer across multiple stages of the patient journey. The role of EBRT and radiation oncology in treating cancer could potentially be enhanced by integrating with therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals and precision diagnostics. Working with Varian, a key player in EBRT, Telix will explore how theranostics can be used more effectively by radiation oncologists to enhance patient selection and deliver targeted treatment. The first area of investigational focus is PSMA-PET[1] imaging for prostate cancer radiotherapy patients. Telix and Varian aim to identify opportunities to utilize Gozellix\u00ae (kit for the preparation of gallium-68 (68Ga) gozetotide injection) and Illuccix\u00ae (kit for the preparation of gallium-68 (68Ga) gozetotide injection)[2] in selecting patients for EBRT, developing personalized treatment plans (particularly in the context of Varian's Ethos adaptive radiotherapy), and monitoring responses to treatment. The agreement supports both company-sponsored and investigator-led clinical studies, enabling robust clinical exploration of novel approaches. While the initial focus is on PSMA imaging, the collaboration has been implemented as a general framework for future co-development opportunities, with broad clinical applicability. This includes other PET imaging candidates in Telix's pipeline, such as TLX250-CDx (Zircaix\u00ae[3]) and TLX101-CDx (Pixclara\u00ae[3]), as well as potential future therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. By combining radiopharmaceutical theranostics with Varian's EBRT technology, the companies believe radiation oncologists are uniquely positioned to lead both definitive and palliative treatment strategies. Dr. Arthur Kaindl, Head of Varian, said, \"Collaborating with Telix opens a powerful pathway to embed precision imaging and theranostics into the radiation therapy workflow, advancing how we personalize and optimize treatment decisions. By combining Telix's strength in molecular imaging and radiopharmaceuticals with Varian's leadership in radiation therapy and treatment planning, we are shaping a future of more targeted, patient-focused cancer care.\" Dr. Christian Behrenbruch, Group CEO and Managing Director, Telix, said, \"This strategic partnership with Varian represents a transformative opportunity to bring precision imaging into the heart of radiation oncology. Integrating theranostics into EBRT has the potential to improve patient outcomes. And by combining Telix's innovation in molecular imaging with Varian's global leadership in cancer treatment technologies, we are building alliances to explore new frontiers in personalized cancer care.\" About Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited Telix is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutic and diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals and associated medical technologies.
