of GC/GEJ", "link": "https://en.prnasia.com/story/497996-0.shtml", "keywords": ["hea", "pha", "mtc", "bio", "tri", "fda"], "creator": null, "description": "SUZHOU, China, July 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Alphamab Oncology (stock code: 9966.HK) announced that anti-HER2 biparatopic antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) JSKN003 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of gastric cancer and gastroesophageal junction cancer (GC/GEJ). GC/GEJ is the fifth most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. According to the 2022 Global Cancer Statistics report released by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a subsidiary of the World Health Organization, there are approximately 960,000 new cases diagnosed and 660,000 deaths worldwide annually. In the U.S., the SEER database model predicts that there will be 26,890 new cases and 10,880 new deaths of GC/GEJ in 2024, with a five-year overall survival rate of less than 40%. Fluoropyrimidine and platinum-based regimens are commonly used as first-line treatments. Available second-line or later-line treatment options include paclitaxel plus ramucirumab, paclitaxel, docetaxel or irinotecan monotherapy, and best supportive care, with objective response rates of approximately 15-25%. The median overall survival is approximately 8-9 months for second-line treatment and 4-6 months for later lines. JSKN003 is an anti-HER2 biparatopic ADC developed inhouse with Alphamab's proprietary glycan-specific conjugation platform. The antibody molecule KN026 is site-specifically modified via enzyme catalytic reaction and click chemistry to achieve a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of approximately 4. It can bind HER2 on the surface of tumor cells, and release topoisomerase I inhibitors (TOPIi) through cellular endocytosis, thereby exert anti-tumor effects. Compared with its ADC counterparts, JSKN003 demonstrated better serum stability and stronger bystander effect, which effectively expands the therapeutic window. Research results from the Phase I clinical study JSKN003-101 (NCT05494918) conducted in Australia and the Phase I/II clinical study JSKN003-102 (NCT05744427) in China have demonstrated favorable tolerability and safety profile, with promising efficacy of JSKN003 in heavily pretreated patients with advanced solid tumors, especially in patients with high HER2-expressing gastrointestinal tumors. Detailed data were presented at the 2024 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress for the first time and subsequently updated at the 2025 Annual Meeting of American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in June 2025. The \"Orphan Drug Designation\", originated from the Orphan Drug Act (ODA), is a U.S. FDA initiative aimed at encouraging the development of innovative drugs for the treatment of diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. The designation of JSKN003 will be beneficial to obtain relevant policy supports for subsequent research and development, registration, and commercialization in the U.S., including funding for research and development costs, tax credits for clinical trial expenditures, waiver of prescription drug user fee, accelerated review and approval processes, and, upon approval, the potential for seven years of market exclusivity in the U.S. About JSKN003 JSKN003 is a bispecific ADC developed based on KN026 using Alphamab's proprietary glycan-specific conjugation platform. JSKN003 can bind HER2 on the surface of tumor cells and release topoisomerase I inhibitors (TOPIi) through cellular endocytosis, thereby exerting anti-tumor effects. Compared with its ADC counterparts, JSKN003 demonstrated better serum stability and stronger bystander effect, which effectively expands the therapeutic window. Results of multiple clinical studies at various stages of JSKN003 in China and Australia have demonstrated favorable safety profile, with promising efficacy of JSKN003 in heavily pretreated patients with advanced solid tumors, especially in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC), HER2-expressing breast cancer (BC), or high HER2-expressing solid tumors. JSKN003 was granted breakthrough therapy designation by CDE. The designation is for the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer. Three Phase III clinical studies of JSKN003 for the treatment of HER2-low expressing BC, PROC, and HER2-positive BC as well as multiple exploratory Phase II clinical studies are currently undergoing smoothly. In September 2024, the Company entered a licensing agreement with JMT-Bio Technology Co., Ltd. (\"JMT-Bio\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. (\"CSPC\") (stock code: 1093.HK), pursuant to which, JMT-Bio was granted the exclusive license and sublicense rights to develop, sell, offer for sale and commercialize JSKN003, for the treatment of tumor-related indications (the \"Field\") in mainland China (excluding Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan) (the \"Territory\") and become the sole marketing authorization holder for JSKN003 for the Field in the Territory. Alphamab retains the sole right to supply JSKN003. About Alphamab Oncology Alphamab Oncology is an innovative biopharmaceutical company focusing on oncology therapeutics. On December 12, 2019, the Company was successfully listed on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, trading under the stock code 9966.

TANGERANG, Indonesia, July 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- PT Eurokars Motor Indonesia (EMI), the Sole Agent and authorized distributor of Mazda vehicles in Indonesia, is set to reaffirm its presence in the premium vehicle market with the launch of The New Mazda CX-60 Sport and Pro, the two latest editions of the Mazda CX-60. The launch is one of the main highlights at the Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show (GIIAS) 2025, currently taking place at ICE BSD City, Tangerang. Ricky Thio, Chief Operating Officer of PT Eurokars Motor Indonesia, with Ade Rai, public figure and fitness practitioner \u2013 at the launch ceremony of The New Mazda CX-60 Sport & Pro at GIIAS 2025 Since its debut in Indonesia in 2023, the Mazda CX-60 has proven itself to be one of Mazda's flagship SUV. Carrying a bold and elegant design (\"The Noble Toughness\"), the Mazda CX-60 secured the top spot in Mazda's Large SUV sales segment in 2024. Building on this momentum, Mazda now arrives in two new editions, Sport Edition and Pro Edition, designed to meet various mobility needs that suit different driving personalities. Both new editions embody the Jinba-Ittai philosophy, creating harmony and unity between the driver and the vehicle. The New Mazda CX-60 Sport and Pro provide broader access for consumers seeking premium quality with more relevant options. The main differences lie in the distinct characteristics of each edition. The New Mazda CX-60 Pro exudes a masculine character, ideal for those who enjoy challenges. This edition is equipped with the i-ACTIV All-Wheel Drive system, providing enhanced stability and optimal manoeuvrability, even at high speeds. Meanwhile, The New Mazda CX-60 Sport is designed for an active lifestyle, offering smart driving efficiency at more competitive price points, without compromising the signature Mazda driving experience. \"Retaining many of the standout features from the previous models (Kuro Edition and Elite Edition), The New Mazda CX-60 Sport and Pro are introduced to meet the needs of consumers who want the Mazda CX-60 at a more competitive price point,\" said Ricky Thio, CEO of PT Eurokars Motor Indonesia. Ricky adds, \"These two latest editions are designed with a human-centric approach, which lies at the heart of every Mazda innovation, crafted to adapt to the needs and lifestyles of today's drivers. The New Mazda CX-60 Sport and Pro are the true embodiment of Mass Craftsmanship, showcasing not only beautiful design and luxury, but also reflect meticulous attention to detail, comfort, and driving experience. Enhanced Driving Performance With dimensions of 4,740 x 1,890 mm, The New Mazda CX-60 Sport and Pro showcase a bold and solid stance. Both the Sport Edition and Pro Edition are designed to meet the needs of efficient urban mobility yet still offering optimal comfort for daily activities. Equipped with a SKYACTIV-G 2.5L Inline 4-cylinder engine, both editions deliver 188 HP and 250 Nm of torque. The 8-speed automatic transmission system, which operates without a torque converter, enables more direct and responsive gear shifts. The SKYACTIV-G technology, with its high compression ratio, is designed to maximize both power and fuel efficiency. The SKYACTIV-DRIVE transmission ensures smooth power delivery with minimal energy loss. Reinforced by the lightweight yet strong SKYACTIV-Body & Chasis structure, as well as the i-Stop system that shuts off the engine during idle, the Mazda CX-60 strikes a balance between performance and efficiency. Premium Cabin Experience Entering the cabin of The New Mazda CX-60 Sport and Pro, a modern-minimalist ambience is immediately apparent. A Power Sliding Panoramic Sunroof and Power Lift Gate with Hands-free Function come as standard features in these latest editions. Furthermore, ventilated leather seats in the front provide added comfort, while titanium-colored accents enhance the modern character of the interior. Equipped with a 12.3-inch media display, Wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, wireless charger, and a premium BOSE audio system with 12 speakers, the Mazda CX-60 cabin is designed to elevate the driving experience. Additionally, The New Mazda CX-60 Pro offers extra comfort through features such as Auto Dimming Outer Mirrors, which reduce glare from trailing vehicles, and Front Passenger Power Lumbar Support to enhance back support for front-seat passengers. Bold Exterior The New Mazda CX-60 Sport and Pro feature a bold and distinctive design highlighted by the use of a Vertical Grille Pattern, Chrome Signature Wing, and Black Matte on the Side Signature, Window Line, and Cladding. The 18-inch metallic wheels on The New Mazda CX-60 Sport and 20-inch wheels on The New Mazda CX-60 Pro further elevate the vehicles' bold and elegant presence in perfect balance. Comprehensive Safety Features More than just performance and design, The New Mazda CX-60 Sport and Pro are also built with great attention to safety. The i-Activsense active safety technology offers comprehensive protection, creating a sense of security and confidence behind the wheel. The Mazda Radar Cruise Control (MRCC) feature helps drivers maintain a safe distance automatically from vehicles ahead, which is ideal for both long-distance trips and heavy traffic. To assist drivers in staying aware of their surroundings, the 360\u00b0 View Monitor with see-through view technology provides a complete perspective around the vehicle, making manoeuvres in tight areas easier. Mazda also includes Smart Brake Support at both the front and rear, which proactively helps prevent collisions or reduce impact by automatically applying brakes when potential danger is detected. Lighting is made more intelligent with Adaptive LED Headlights, which adjust direction and brightness based on road conditions and speed. Meanwhile, Lane-keep Assist and Blind Spot Monitoring help keep the driver on track and protected from vehicles approaching from blind spots or the side. Specifically for The New Mazda CX-60 Pro Edition, Mazda adds the Driver Monitoring System, which closely observes the driver's level of alertness. The system detects signs of fatigue or distraction and issues an early warning, delivering enhanced peace of mind on every journey. Furthermore, the Driver Personalization System allows automatic adjustment of the seat position, mirrors, and head-up display based on the driver's physical profile. Price and Availability The New Mazda CX-60 Sport comes at IDR 699,000,000 (OTR Jakarta), and The New Mazda CX-60 Pro is available for IDR 818.800.000 (OTR Jakarta).

According to Ade Rai, Mazda has become a part of his personal identity, reflecting how he wants to be perceived by the public, \"I have been using Mazda for a long time, from the Mazda6 Sedan, Mazda MX-5, and now the Mazda CX-60 Sport. It is very likely I will own more Mazda cars in the future. For me, Mazda is a reflection of myself, part of who I am. I feel connected to the values Mazda stands for. Mazda always prioritizes functionality and the human-centered driving experience. It is not just about making cars that look cool or flashy. I believe the same applies to life.

About Mazda Indonesia At Mazda, we believe in the emotional bond between driver and vehicle, as if the car has a soul of its own. This philosophy is embodied in our KODO Design, Soul of Motion. Inspired by the graceful energy of a cheetah in full sprint, KODO captures the purest expression of motion, transforming it into captivating automotive design. KODO finds its roots in timeless Japanese aesthetics. Japanese craftsmanship has always celebrated the beauty of simplicity, a form of elegance that radiates dignity and sensuality. Mazda interprets these values through \"RIN\" (dignified control) and \"EN\" (captivating sensuality), two defining traits of Japanese elegance. Together, they shape the distinctive premium character of our vehicles, seen in models like the Mazda2 Hatchback, Mazda6, Mazda CX-5, and Mazda Biante. Each is a testament to our commitment to design that moves not only the body, but also the feelings.
