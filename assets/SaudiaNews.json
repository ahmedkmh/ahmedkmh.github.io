First launched in the United States in 2024, Lyric has quickly gained traction for its human-centered design and flexibility. Building on that success, the platform has now been deployed and tested for the ANZ market to address regional compliance requirements and workplace needs. Designed for the way people actually work today, Lyric transforms how organisations attract, engage, and empower their workforce. By combining core HR, onboarding, time and attendance, talent, recruitment, and analytics into a single, cloud-based solution, Lyric enables HR leaders to simplify operations, enhance the employee experience, and drive business performance. Lyric has been recognized as a Top HR Product of 2025 by HR Executive for AI-powered, human-centered HCM innovation. Smarter, simpler, more humanPowered by ADP's 75+ years of innovation and developed with direct input from clients across the region, Lyric is designed to support agile, confident business operations. Its graph-based architecture models real-world structures and relationships, while low-code configurability allows HR and payroll teams to adapt quickly to changes. With AI at its core, Lyric uses intelligent search and in-app analytics to support more informed decision-making and streamlined, automated workflows. \"Lyric redefines how organisations in ANZ manage their people,\" said Kylie Baullo, managing director, ADP ANZ and Japan. \"It combines automation, compliance confidence, and human-centred design into one intelligent experience. Our goal is to make payroll and HR effortless so leaders can focus on what really matters \u2014 their people and their business.\" Tailored for the ANZ marketLyric is designed to meet the complex compliance requirements of the ANZ region. It adheres to Australian Fair Work regulations, including state-specific Long Service Leave requirements, Single Touch Payroll reporting, and tax and superannuation compliance. It also aligns with New Zealand's Holidays Act and the obligations set by the Inland Revenue Department, including KiwiSaver and Payday Reporting. Built-in regulatory intelligence ensures that updates are applied in a timely manner, helping organisations stay compliant as rules evolve. A recent survey by the Australian Payroll Association revealed that one in three Australian companies reported not completing a payroll compliance audit in the past three years, and many cited keeping up with legislation as one of their biggest challenge1. Lyric directly addresses these issues with always-on payroll calculations, automated downstream payments, and audit-ready reporting.
