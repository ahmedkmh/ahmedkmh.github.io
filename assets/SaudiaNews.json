What began in 1925 with voluntary vehicle inspections is now a global expert organization for safety, sustainability, and digital trust. On its centennial, DEKRA reaffirms its commitment to tackling the major challenges of our time \u2013 in line with its anniversary motto: \"Securing the Future.\" DEKRA was founded on June 30, 1925, in Berlin as the \"Deutscher Kraftfahrzeug-U\u0308berwachungs-Verein\" (German Motor Vehicle Inspection Association) \u2013 at a time when the automobile was beginning to reshape the world. Its mission: voluntary technical inspections to bring safety to a new era of mobility. A century later, this initiative has evolved into a global expert organization with 48,000 employees in around 60 countries \u2013 all pursuing one clear goal: enabling safety and trust in a changing world. What began in 1925 with vehicle inspections has grown into a comprehensive portfolio across mobility, industry, environment, and digital technologies. DEKRA tests both physical and digital products, processes, and systems. \"Safety is not static \u2013 it evolves with the world we live in,\" says CEO Stan Zurkiewicz. \"Our task is to help shape key areas of transformation \u2013 mobility, digitalization, artificial intelligence, and sustainability \u2013 with expertise, responsibility, and foresight.\" Shaping Germany \u2013 Expanding Globally DEKRA's history is marked by constant progress. When periodic vehicle inspections became mandatory in Germany in 1951, DEKRA played a key role in their implementation. The 1960s and 1970s brought a focus on education and research, including the founding of DEKRA Akademie (1974), the Research and Development department (1968), and Accident Research (1978) \u2013 the latter with the aim of learning from data. After German reunification, DEKRA took over responsibilities from the former East German vehicle authority and built a comprehensive inspection network in the new federal states. Shortly thereafter, the company entered international markets, including France, Spain, China, and the United States. Since then, DEKRA has pursued a globally focused strategy \u2013 while maintaining strong roots in its home market of Germany.
