Financial Results for the Third Quarter of 2025 Revenues Total revenues were RMB31,562 million (US$4,434 million) for the third quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 9.1% from RMB28,924 million for the third quarter of 2024 and an increase of 15.1% from RMB27,431 million for the second quarter of 2025. Revenues from vehicle sales were RMB26,527 million (US$3,726 million) for the third quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 7.3% from RMB24,724 million for the third quarter of 2024, and an increase of 15.8% from RMB22,916 million for the second quarter of 2025. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases were mainly driven by higher vehicle sales volume due to the launch of new and facelifted models in the third quarter of 2025. Revenues from other sales and services were RMB5,035 million (US$708 million) for the third quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 19.9% from RMB4,200 million for the third quarter of 2024 and an increase of 11.5% from RMB4,515 million for the second quarter of 2025. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to an increase in after-sales spare parts revenue, which is in line with higher accumulated vehicle sales. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to an increase in R&D revenue from related parties in the third quarter of 2025. Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin Cost of revenues was RMB25,516 million (US$3,584 million) for the third quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 4.1% from RMB24,515 million for the third quarter of 2024 and an increase of 17.2% from RMB21,775 million for the second quarter of 2025. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to the increase in vehicle deliveries, partially offset by the lower average cost of sales due to cost reductions and the change in product mix. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily attributable to the increase in vehicle deliveries and the high average cost of sales due to the change in product mix. Gross profit was RMB6,046 million (US$850 million) for the third quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 37.1% from RMB4,409 million for the third quarter of 2024 and an increase of 6.9% from RMB5,656 million for the second quarter of 2025. Gross margin was 19.2% for the third quarter of 2025, compared with 15.2% for the third quarter of 2024 and 20.6% for the second quarter of 2025. Vehicle margin was 15.6% for the third quarter of 2025, compared with 12.6% for the third quarter of 2024 and 17.3% for the second quarter of 2025. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributed to sustained cost-saving initiatives. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to the pace of cost reduction for newly launched models and the product mix. Operating Expenses Research and development expenses were RMB2,743 million (US$385 million) for the third quarter of 2025, representing a decrease of 8.6% from RMB3,000 million for the third quarter of 2024 and an increase of 27.8% from RMB2,146 million for the second quarter of 2025. The year-over-year decrease and quarter-over-quarter increase were mainly in line with timing and progress of new vehicle programs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB3,783 million (US$532 million) for the third quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 11.3% from RMB3,398 million for the third quarter of 2024 and an increase of 12.5% from RMB3,364 million for the second quarter of 2025. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases were primarily attributable to higher marketing and advertising expenses to support new vehicle model launches and sales growth. (Loss)/income from Operations Loss from operations was RMB56 million (US$8 million) for the third quarter of 2025, compared with RMB2,076 million loss from operations in the third quarter of 2024 and RMB285 million income from operations in the second quarter of 2025.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share attributed to ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per ADS attributed to ordinary shareholders, in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. By excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business and enhance the overall understanding of the Company's past performance and future prospects. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company's management in its financial and operational decision-making. The non-GAAP financial measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing the Company's operating performance, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss or other consolidated statements of comprehensive loss data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP Results\" set forth in this announcement.

Domestic and international experts concurred that while Vietnam has significant advantages to become a regional healthcare hub, several barriers must be swiftly resolved. Da Nang Global Business Summit Outlines Roadmap for Medical and Wellness Tourism Development In her opening remarks, Ms. Huynh Lien Phuong, Deputy Chief of the Da Nang City People's Committee Office, reaffirmed the city's commitment to implementing its medical tourism development plan through 2050, with the goal of positioning Da Nang as a safe, modern, and distinctive destination. The summit highlighted Vietnam and Da Nang's outstanding strengths: Dual infrastructure advantage: A combination of world-class tourism facilities (leading the nation in five-star hotels) and a robust healthcare system, with 65 hospitals across the Da Nang\u2013Quang Nam cluster. Highly skilled and competitive costs: Vietnam has established a reputation in key fields such as IVF and cosmetic dentistry, with costs 50\u201370% lower than in markets like the U.S. or Australia. Digital readiness: Da Nang leads nationally, with 90% of hospitals implementing electronic medical records (EMR) and nearly all healthcare facilities connected to electronic insurance systems. Alongside these strengths, experts candidly pointed out major \"bottlenecks\" hindering growth: Foreign currency outflow: Vietnam loses an estimated USD 2 billion annually as citizens seek treatment abroad, underscoring the urgent need to build trust in domestic services. Policy gaps: The absence of a dedicated medical visa creates significant difficulties for international patients and families requiring long-term stays for treatment. Data \"islands\": Despite widespread EMR adoption, national and international health data exchange backbone. Patient information remains siloed within hospitals, preventing seamless care journeys. Language barriers: Limited English proficiency among medical staff and healthcare workers directly impacts international patient experience and reduces Vietnam's competitiveness compared to regional rivals. To address these challenges, speakers offered key recommendations: Ms. Perkins Florence Gaudry, Founder & CEO of Digital Health Partnership (DHP), stressed: \"AI and digital health are the future, but AI requires quality data. Vietnam's biggest challenge today is the lack of a national health data exchange. Investing in this infrastructure is an urgent step.\" Dr. Truong Nguyen Thoai Nhan, Director of Hoan My Da Nang Hospital, emphasized: \"In medical tourism, trust is the decisive factor\u2014more important than price. That trust must be built on international standards such as JCI and a flawless customer experience, from airport pickup to safe return home.\" At the Summit's conclusion, participants agreed that Vietnam's success in medical tourism depends not only on promoting strengths but on decisive action to synchronize policy and technology, with customer experience and trust at the core. The Summit's success was made possible through the support of strategic partners, advisors, sponsors, and media collaborators, including: Hoan My Da Nang Hospital, AdTech Innovation, AmCham, Novotel Danang Premier Han River, Fusion Resort & Villas Da Nang, Digital Health Partnership, Da Nang Investment Promotion Agency, Da Nang Tourism Promotion Center, Da Nang Tourism Association, Da Nang Department of Culture, Sports & Tourism, Da Nang Department of Health, Danang Fantasticity, PR Newswire, and La La Land.
