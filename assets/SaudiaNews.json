New Cast Comments Arrived! new casts Yumiri Hanamori (Asako Yamagishi) I'm Yumiri Hanamori, who will be playing the role of Asako Yamagishi in \"The Summer Hikaru Died\". The first time I read this work, I was greatly shocked that the story begins from the point where it didn't make it in time. In a place that shouldn't have existed. What if \"something\" very close to what didn't make it appears in front of us? What choice would we choose? What will be awaiting them at the end of their summer? I will do my best to play the role so that you can feel the atmosphere that sticks to your skin. Thank you very much. Wakana Kowaka (Rie Kurebayashi) I'm Wakana Kowaka, who will be playing the role of Rie Kurebayashi. I'm looking forward to seeing how this work, which is filled with various emotions, how it will be visualized. And the Mie dialect! We are all working so hard to record it! I want to do my best to play Rie Kurebayashi, who is close to Yoshiki and Hikaru and has kindness in her sternness. Chikahiro Kobayashi (Tanaka) When I read the original story, my heart was firmly grasped from the beginning! The scene of \"Summer\" that everyone feels nostalgic for is mixed with the fear and wonder of not knowing what is happening. It's really interesting. I'm very happy to be able to mix in with the atmosphere of this work...! Let's watch it together when summer comes! Additional character information released!! characters visual Asako Yamagishi (voiced by Yumiri Hanamori) A classmate of Yoshiki. Since childhood, she has been able to \"hear\" things that ordinary people cannot. She is tall, lively, and intelligent. Rie Kurebayashi (voiced by Wakana Kowaka) A housewife who can \"see\" things that ordinary people cannot. She worries about Yoshiki, who is with a dangerous and terrifying presence, and warns him to stay away. Tanaka (voiced by Chikahiro Kobayashi) A man who seems to be investigating something for a certain company. He is always carefree and elusive. He has a hamster as his partner. The ending theme song features the currently trending artist, TOOBOE! Theme Song for the Ending \"Anata wa Kaibutsu(you are my monster)\" by TOOBOE Lyrics, Composition, and Arrangement by TOOBOE Release: Summer 2025 TOOBOE( Ending theme song artist) Hello, I'm TOOBOE, and I will be in charge of the ending theme song. In creating this piece, I delved deeply into the original story, contemplating how one might savor memories and promises upon realizing that the neighbor the one believed to be true isn't actually who the one thought. The more I tried to understand Yoshiki's feelings, the more pure, sorrowful, and cruel they became. The resulting song, \"Anata wa Kaibutsu(you are my monster)\" became a kind of forgiveness that I extended to the characters. I hope it can add a vibrant touch to this wonderful story. Thank you for your support.

The heat oozing out of the characters, and the reconstruction of the original character modeling, which seems to depict that as well, was a challenge that had never been attempted before. We hope that we were able to reproduce the body temperature of the characters that we felt from the original work. Masanobu Hiraoka (DORODORO Animator) I am always thinking about how to express the unique and unsettling atmosphere of \"The Summer Hikaru Died\" in terms of the artwork. In particular, the depiction of \"DORODORO\" with a heterogeneous presence is one of the important elements that accentuate the eeriness of this work. The viscosity and weight of the movement, as well as the unpleasantness of the spread of the \"DORODORO\" were carefully considered in order to leave a strong impression on the audience. We made sure that the disturbing nature of the original work and the horror that lurks within its beauty could be expressed in the images. I hope you will enjoy the \"distorted beauty\" that only a film can capture. Taro Umebayashi (Music) I am very honored to be involved in Mokumokuren's \"The Summer Hikaru Died\" which is loved by so many fans. I am working on the music for the animation directed by Ryohei Takeshita so that I can contribute to the expression of the work in any way I can.
