The move follows growing demand from international brands seeking advanced anti-counterfeiting and supply-chain authentication solutions. The Coder's proprietary technology embeds an invisible, camera-readable code into virtually any material surface - such as paper, plastic, leather, or metal - using existing printing, laser engraving, molding, or pressing equipment. The code is invisible to the naked eye but instantly readable through smartphones and standard digital devices, enabling fast verification without requiring new hardware or major workflow changes. \"Our technology offers global brands a highly secure and practical way to authenticate products and block unauthorized distribution,\" said Haeng-Woon Park, CEO of The Coder. \"Unlike RFID or NFC tags, our invisible codes cannot be cloned or removed, providing a much stronger layer of protection.\" JV Strategy to Accelerate Market Entry With rising interest from cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and luxury brands, The Coder selected Taiwan as its first overseas base due to its strong connections with European luxury brands and Southeast Asia's high-value footwear manufacturing brands. To speed up market entry and reduce operational risk, The Coder adopted a JV-based approach, partnering with Taiwanese manufacturer MINZ. The company also received support from Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT and the Global Digital Innovation Network (GDIN), which provided legal, administrative, and business development. The JV is scheduled to complete setup by year-end and begin operations on January 1. Global Growth Platform Built Through the Taiwan JV The Taiwan JV will function as The Coder's central platform for scaling multiple global initiatives. Its initial focus is to support international brands implementing invisible code\u2013based authentication, where demand is rapidly increasing, especially among luxury and high-value product categories. Beyond authentication, the JV will lead The Coder into new regulatory and industrial markets. With the European Union advancing its Digital Product Passport (DPP) framework, The Coder plans to offer manufacturers a secure method to track product origins, material composition, and sustainability metrics across the supply chain. The JV will also support expansion into the China security market and serve as a launchpad for broader growth across Indonesia, Turkey, India, and Pakistan beginning in 2025. These markets represent significant global manufacturing and consumer hubs, giving The Coder a strong foundation for long-term international scaling. The company aims to surpass USD 3.2 million in overseas revenue next year. Advancing Machine-Readable Identity for the AI Era At its Korea headquarters, The Coder continues strengthening its core technologies for future AI and robotics applications. The company is also developing new formats, including sound-based codes, to expand the possibilities of secure machine-readable identification.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["cxp", "hrd", "jvn", "scl", "trn", "cpr"], "creator": null, "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["technology", "top"], "datatype": "news", "pubDate": "2025-12-15 01:00:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 4111305, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/en_prnasisa.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": true}, {"article_id": "b497450eb118a947d067462bf67bd0d1", "link": "https://en.prnasia.com/story/515950-0.shtml", "title": "Letitu Establishes Malaysia Joint Venture to Accelerate Southeast Asia Expansion", "description": "KUALA LUMPUR and CYBERJAYA, Malaysia, Dec. 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Letitu, the global EdTech company behind the AI-powered academic and career planning platform The Pond, has established a new joint venture (JV) in Malaysia to spearhead its expansion across Southeast Asia. The new entity, TeXphere, was incorporated in September and will begin full-scale operations in early 2026. Letitu's flagship solution, The Pond, has gained wide international traction for helping students, teachers, and counselors navigate complex academic and career decisions. The AI-driven platform recommends suitable courses, activities, and university pathways based on students' interests, strengths, and career aspirations. It is already being used across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Thailand, Japan, and Kazakhstan, where the company currently derives 70% of its revenue. \"Students often struggle to find clear, structured guidance because information is scattered,\" said Sean Lee, Co-Founder of Letitu and Director of Malaysia JV. \"The Pond brings everything together through AI, enabling students and educators to make confident decisions about academics, university admissions, and even early career planning.\" Malaysia Chosen as Strategic Hub for Southeast Asia Letitu selected Malaysia as its regional base due to the country's rapidly growing EdTech landscape and strong emphasis on digital innovation. The global EdTech community has also recognized Malaysia's rising influence, with Kuala Lumpur serving as the Asian host city for the world-renowned BETT exhibition for several consecutive years. \"Malaysia is emerging as one of Asia's most dynamic EdTech markets,\" Lee said. \"Its forward-looking educational environment makes it the ideal launchpad for our Southeast Asia expansion.\" Joint Venture with Local EdTech Leader Shft To ensure strong local execution, Letitu partnered with Shft, a Malaysian EdTech company that works closely with leading institutions such as the University of Malaya. The two companies were introduced during a major EdTech exhibition in Kuala Lumpur and quickly identified strong synergy in supporting learning innovation. The JV, named TeXphere, is structured with Letitu holding 80% and Shft holding 20%. Lee will lead the venture as Managing Director and oversee business development, partnerships, and product rollout across Malaysia. \"Shft's deep network and on-the-ground expertise will allow us to scale faster and respond effectively to local needs,\" Lee added. WelKo and Additional Services to Launch Through TeXphere Beyond The Pond, Letitu plans to introduce WelKo, a new platform designed to help international students navigate Korean university admissions independently, without intermediaries. The service will formally launch in Malaysia through the JV and target both local and international school communities. TeXphere will also explore further collaborations with schools and develop tech-focused education programs tailored to Malaysia's rapidly advancing digital ecosystem. \"Starting next year, Southeast Asia will become one of Letitu's key growth pillars,\" Lee said. \"Through TeXphere, we are committed to contributing to Malaysia's EdTech innovation and supporting students across the region.\"", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["edu", "cxp", "ite", "con", "cpr", "jvn", "tls"], "creator": null, "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["technology", "top"], "datatype": "news", "pubDate": "2025-12-15 01:00:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 4111305, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/en_prnasisa.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "1ffad5b5cefaaa92c7392196dd0cfc84", "link": "https://en.prnasia.com/story/515949-0.shtml", "title": "FUJIFILM Business Innovation Celebrates 60 Years in the Philippines and Singapore; Marks 30th Anniversary in Chinese Mainland", "description": "The milestone marks a legacy of leadership in digital transformation and sustainability across Asia-Pacific MANILA, Philippines and SINGAPORE, Dec. 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- FUJIFILM Business Innovation, a leader in information workflows and digital transformation, is celebrating its 60th anniversary in the Philippines and Singapore. Starting in 1965, the Philippines was the company's first overseas market, and soon after it established operations in Singapore. This year also marks the 30th anniversary of FUJIFILM Business Innovation China, further underscoring the company's long and enduring operational history across the Asia Pacific region. These milestones reflect decades of innovation, sustainable business practices, and strong partnerships that continue to shape the region's digital transformation (DX) landscape. Mr. Naoki Hama, President and CEO, Representative Director, FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp., remarked: \"We at FUJIFILM Business Innovation have been helping companies in Asia-Pacific strategically leverage information for over 60 years. While maintaining this focus, we are continuing to evolve the format, expanding beyond traditional printing into digital transformation, AI utilisation, and IT services. Our key hubs in the region have been vital for our digitalisation and sustainability initiatives. As we continue to evolve as a company, we look forward to creating further opportunities for the region's businesses to drive operational innovation through data utilization and reduce the environmental impact.\" A regional strategy built on local strength In Asia-Pacific, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make up 98% of all businesses and employ over half of the workforce, creating significant potential for DX and AI to have an economic impact. Given the importance of software, FUJIFILM established a development centre in Vietnam in April 2025. Across the region, the company relies on partnerships with businesses that are closely connected to local communities. To this end, the company is fostering collaborations with partners in other areas to continue strengthening its development efforts and regional ecosystem. Mr. Masatsugu Naito, President of FUJIFILM Business Innovation Asia-Pacific, commented: \"In spite of challenges for the printing sector, we see significant opportunities in digital transformation, AI, and integrated solutions, particularly in the dynamic, diverse Asia-Pacific region. Our relationships with deeply rooted local partners here have been key to our success thus far and will continue to be so in our growing focus on data and process automation.\" The Philippines as a circular manufacturing hub With its skilled workforce and manufacturing expertise, the Philippines has been a core part of FUJIFILM's global operations and commitment to sustainability. Over the decades, the company has built deep relationships with local customers, partners, and the government, creating a foundation for long-term growth and mutual success. In July 2025, FUJIFILM Business Innovation announced the establishment of the Circular Manufacturing Centre (CMC), making FUJIFILM Optics Philippines Inc. (FOPH) in to the company's Asia-Pacific hub for resource circulation. Once operations begin in 2026, this facility will handle remanufacturing processes for the company's multifunction devices (MFDs). Each machine is disassembled to the component level, cleaned and inspected thoroughly, and rebuilt while ensuring the same quality and reliability standards as newly built machines. The process achieves a reuse rate of 84% by weight, while the remaining 16% is recycled, resulting in a 99.5% resource recovery rate \u2014 one of the highest in the company's industry worldwide. In addition to contributing to local economic growth and talent development, the CMC's capabilities in resource circulation are crucial for the company making progress on its Recycling Policy \"Promoting Resource Circulation Toward Zero Waste,\" which was established in 1995. Innovating to transform how enterprises handle data As technology has evolved, the company has been particularly successful at harnessing comprehensive DX, AI, and IT solutions. Mr. Hama continued: \"FUJIFILM Business Innovation has consistently focused on helping companies handle data \u2014 but we have evolved in the ways we do so. We started as a document company focused on paper output. Then, demand for paper digitisation increased after the pandemic significantly changed work styles. Today, FUJIFILM Business Innovation is moving towards being a service and solutions company rather than just a multifunction printer manufacturer, but our focus on information handling has not changed.\" One of its more recent solutions is the FUJIFILM IWpro, a cloud-based platform that centralises data across systems and enables secure, seamless collaboration among various stakeholders. Integrating AI into solutions and operations As part of its transformation strategy, FUJIFILM is integrating AI in three ways: Using AI to learn from past sales cases and improve internal operational efficiency Embedding AI technology within devices, such as eliminating time-consuming pre-printing adjustments for paper types and using predictive maintenance algorithms to replace components before they fail Integrating AI into solutions and services, such as intelligent document processing of unstructured data, including paper documents to extract key information This three-pronged strategy reflects the company's belief that AI should not replace human creativity but rather enhance decision-making and enable smarter, faster, and more sustainable business practices.
