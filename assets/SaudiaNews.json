Recent Developments Delivery Update In April, Zeekr Group delivered a total of 41,316 vehicles across its Zeekr and Lynk & Co brands, marking a 1.5% increase compared to the previous month. This achievement was made possible by the trust and support of over 1.9 million users. Specifically, the Zeekr brand delivered 13,727 vehicles, while Lynk & Co brand delivered 27,589 vehicles. New Model Launches The Zeekr 7GT, the brand's second shooting brake, was launched in China on April 15, 2025. Equipped with advanced silicon carbide-powered e-motors, the vehicle achieves 0-100 km/h acceleration in merely 2.95 seconds under rolling start conditions. Exceptional performance and world-class safety features position the Zeekr 7GT for a strong showing in global markets. Zeekr Group also unveiled its flagship luxury SUV, the Zeekr 9X, at the Shanghai Auto Show. As the first hybrid model under the Zeekr brand, the Zeekr 9X sets new benchmarks in design, performance, and electrification, marking a major leap forward for the brand. This groundbreaking model is slated for a global launch in the third quarter of 2025. On April 28, the Lynk & Co brand commenced deliveries of the Lynk & Co 900, a large six-seater family SUV. Built on the powerful SPA Evo platform, the top-tier variant is equipped with the G-Pilot H7 package, featuring NVIDIA's DRIVE AGX Thor computing platform with an industry-leading 700 TOPS of processing power. With its expansive interior, cutting-edge technology, and thrilling performance, the model has already garnered over 40,000 pre-orders since its debut in December. CEO and CFO Comments \"We achieved a major milestone during the first quarter with the full integration of Zeekr and Lynk & Co, which expanded our global user base to over 1.9 million,\" said Mr. Andy An, Zeekr Group's Chief Executive Officer. \"The two brands' initial technological consolidation has already boosted profitability through optimized R&D and shared platforms. As we accelerate into our next growth phase, we will continue to redefine premium mobility through technology-driven experiences and luxury service, strengthening our position as the world's leading premium new energy vehicle group.\" Mr. Jing Yuan, Zeekr Group's Chief Financial Officer, added, \"In the first quarter of 2025, enhanced platform synergies and disciplined supply chain management drove record profitability, with our overall vehicle margin reaching 16.5% and the Zeekr brand's margin rising to an unprecedented 21.2%. Looking ahead, we will remain laser-focused on deepening resource integration and unlocking greater synergistic value to deliver enhanced returns for our shareholders and build enduring value.\" Financial Results for the First Quarter of 2025 Revenues Total revenues were RMB22,019 million (US$3,034 million) for the first quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 1.1% from RMB21,781 million for the first quarter of 2024 and a decrease of 37.8% from RMB35,377 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. Revenues from vehicle sales were RMB19,096 million (US$2,631 million) for the first quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 16.1% from RMB16,450 million for the first quarter of 2024, and a decrease of 38.4% from RMB31,015 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. The year-over-year increase was attributable to the increase in new model delivery volume, partially offset by the lower average selling price due to changes in product mix and pricing strategy between the two quarters. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in delivery volume, which was affected by seasonal factors. Revenues from other sales and services were RMB2,923 million (US$403 million) for the first quarter of 2025, representing a decrease of 45.2% from RMB5,331 million for the first quarter of 2024 and a decrease of 33.0% from RMB4,362 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. The year-over-year decrease was mainly due to the decreased sales volume and unit price of battery packs and electric drives. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to a decrease in sales of R&D services to our related parties and reduced OEM production volumes at Lynk & Co's manufacturing facilities in the first quarter of 2025. Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin Cost of revenues was RMB17,806 million (US$2,454 million) for the first quarter of 2025, representing a decrease of 2.4% from RMB18,236 million for the first quarter of 2024 and a decrease of 38.6% from RMB29,012 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. The slight year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to the ongoing vehicle cost-saving initiatives, partially offset by increased vehicle deliveries, as well as reductions stemming from lower sales of battery packs and other components. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to the reduced vehicle delivery volume combined with sustained vehicle cost-saving initiatives. Gross profit was RMB4,213 million (US$580 million) for the first quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 18.8% from RMB3,545 million for the first quarter of 2024 and a decrease of 33.8% from RMB6,365 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. Gross margin was 19.1% for the first quarter of 2025, compared with 16.3% for the first quarter of 2024 and 18.0% for the fourth quarter of 2024. Vehicle margin was 16.5% for the first quarter of 2025, compared with 13.1% for the first quarter of 2024 and 14.3% for the fourth quarter of 2024. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases were primarily attributed to sustained cost-saving initiatives, partly offset by the lower average selling price of vehicles. Operating Expenses Research and development expenses were RMB2,908 million (US$401 million) for the first quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 25.0% from RMB2,326 million for the first quarter of 2024 and a decrease of 25.6% from RMB3,910 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to incremental costs associated with the development of our new vehicle platform. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly driven by accelerated progressing of R&D projects in Q4 2024 to align with the 2025 product launch timelines. Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB2,645 million (US$364 million) for the first quarter of 2025, representing a decrease of 9.2% from RMB2,913 million for the first quarter of 2024 and a decrease of 35.8% from RMB4,123 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases were mainly attributable to higher marketing and advertising expenses to support new vehicle model launches in Q1 2024 and Q4 2024, as well as stringent cost discipline implemented under the Company's 2025 efficiency enhancement program. Loss from Operations Loss from operations was RMB1,259 million (US$174 million) for the first quarter of 2025, representing a decrease of 25.7% from RMB1,694 million for the first quarter of 2024 and an increase of 16.3% from RMB1,083 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP loss from operations, which excludes share-based compensation expenses from loss from operations, was RMB1,136 million (US$157 million) for the first quarter of 2025, representing a decrease of 32.8% from RMB1,691 million for the first quarter of 2024 and an increase of 14.3% from RMB994 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. Net Loss and Net Loss Per Share Net loss was RMB763 million (US$105 million) for the first quarter of 2025, representing a decrease of 60.2% from RMB1,915 million for the first quarter of 2024 and an increase of 21.3% from RMB629 million for the fourth quarter of 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share attributed to ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per ADS attributed to ordinary shareholders, in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. By excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business and enhance the overall understanding of the Company's past performance and future prospects. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company's management in its financial and operational decision-making. The non-GAAP financial measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing the Company's operating performance, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss or other consolidated statements of comprehensive loss data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP Results\" set forth in this announcement.
