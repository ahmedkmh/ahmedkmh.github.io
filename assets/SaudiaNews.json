Saudi Arabia Launches Groundbreaking Drought Resilience Initiative at UNCCD COP16 to Accelerate Global Action In partnership with UNCCD, countries, international organizations and other stakeholders, the initiative will work to deliver a transformative shift in how drought is tackled around the world. Harnessing the collective impact of major global institutions, it will move drought management beyond reactive crisis response, through enhancing early warning systems, financing, vulnerability assessments, and drought risk mitigation. \"The Riyadh Drought Resilience Partnership will serve as a global facilitator, a 'one-stop shop' for drought resilience, promoting the shift from reactive relief response after drought hits to proactive preparedness. We also seek to amplify global resources to save lives and livelihoods around the world,\" said Dr. Osama Faqeeha, Deputy Minister for Environment, Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture, and Advisor to the UNCCD COP16 Presidency. \"We are calling on countries, companies, organizations, scientists, NGOs, financial institutions and communities to join this pivotal partnership and become part of a global movement to build a drought-resilient future. This is an environmental and economic imperative; it is far more cost-effective to take a proactive approach to drought resilience than a reactive one. Together, we can slow and reverse the devastating impact of drought. As an international community, we have the tools to take decisive action, the Riyadh Global Drought Resilience Partnership will help ensure we do.\" Dr. Faqeeha added. The partnership will be operated by a permanent office, under the oversight of contributing members, to connect vulnerable countries and communities with existing resources, whilst synergizing with ongoing initiatives to maximize impact. The Riyadh Partnership will also prioritize unlocking new funding mechanisms for drought resilience, increasing access to credit, equity financing, insurance products and grants. To ensure sustained operational support and long-term impact, Saudi Arabia will cover the expenses of the Partnership office for at least 10 years. Ibrahim Thiaw, UNCCD Executive Secretary, said: \"While no nation is immune to drought, 85% of the people impacted by it live in low- and middle-income countries. In a globalized world, it is our collective responsibility, and our shared interest, to liberate everybody, everywhere, from the worst impacts of drought. I trust the Riyadh Global Drought Resilience Partnership will play an important role in mobilizing finance and political will for a more resilient future.\" Droughts impact almost every corner of the planet with 1.84 billion people affected in 2022, and over 55 countries declaring drought emergencies between 2020 and 2023, according to UNCCD. Meanwhile, their impact appears to only be worsening. In Africa, 38% of reported land area was affected by drought between 2016 and 2019, and Latin America and the Caribbean experienced similar devastation, with 37.9% of reported land area affected during the same period, based on UNCCD findings. Drought is a driving cause of food and water insecurity, displacing millions, and exacting a devastating economic toll on impacted countries. ABOUT COP16 RIYADH The UNCCD COP16 conference will take place from December 2-13, 2024, at Boulevard Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia. The conference, themed 'Our Land. Our Future', will mark the 30th anniversary of UNCCD and aims to secure multilateral action on critical issues such as land restoration, drought resilience, land tenure, and sand and dust storms.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2024-12-03 10:31:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://mma.prnasia.com/media2/2556588/5056017/UNCCD_COP16__Logo.jpg?p=medium600", "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_priority": 1333464, "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/en_prnasisa.png", "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top"], "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": true}, {"article_id": "6d40ca3a5f88614e4f0f0e93392e5178", "title": "\u062d\u0645\u0644\u0629 \u062f\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u0639\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0655\u0633\u0631\u0627\u064a\u0654\u064a\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0636\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629", "link": "https://arabic.rt.com/middle_east/1625163-%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%AF%D9%87%D9%85-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B6%D9%81%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9/", "keywords": null, "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "\u0634\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0655\u0633\u0631\u0627\u064a\u0654\u064a\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u0630 \u0645\u0633\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0654\u0645\u0633 \u0648\u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0635\u0628\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0627\u0621 \u062d\u0645\u0644\u0629 \u0645\u062f\u0627\u0647\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0639\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0637\u0627\u0644\u062a \u0639\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u062f\u0646 \u0648\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0636\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0641\u0642\u0627 \u0644\u0646\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0654\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2024-12-03 10:30:56", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/media/pics/2024.12/thumbnail/674ed980423604410f159ba1.jpg", "source_id": "arabic.rt", "source_priority": 2951, "source_name": "Arabic", "source_url": "https://arabic.rt.com", "source_icon": null, "language": "arabic", "country": ["united arab emirates", "georgia", "yemen", "afghanistan", "cyprus", "saudi arabia", "pakistan", "egypt", "lebanon", "kyrgyzstan", "syria", "israel", "djibouti", "iran", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "morocco", "kazakhstan", "iraq", "kuwait", "ethiopia", "azerbaijan", "jordan", "sudan", "somalia", "algeria", "oman", "libya", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "mauritania", "bahrain", "tunisia", "tajikistan"], "category": ["world"], "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "38c488851a06ad91181c132be0187a55", "title": "\u0642\u0644\u0642 \u0648\u0627\u0643\u062a\u064a\u0654\u0627\u0628 \u0648\u0647\u0630\u064a\u0627\u0646.. \"\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0635\u064a\u0645\u064a\" \u064a\u062d\u0630\u0651\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0627\u0654\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0636\u0627\u062f\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u062d\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0629 -

The series invites viewers to experience the sweetness and challenges of youth while exploring the meaning of young love and non-traditional family dynamics. The story follows Cecilia, a 17-year-old girl yearning for familial warmth, who is adopted by the Murphy family following a family tragedy, becoming the nominal sister of Jacob Murphy. Jacob, cold and distant, lives under the shadow of his parents' divorce and views Cecilia's arrival with hostility. While Cecilia tries to adapt to her new environment and integrate into the family, Jacob's sensitivity to familial changes makes him fear she will take away the little affection his mother still shows him. Consequently, he treats Cecilia with deliberate indifference and even avoids her at school. However, through a series of events at school and home, their relationship begins to subtly shift. Through shared experiences, they come to understand each other's inner worlds and reevaluate their complex \"sibling\" connection.

According to AMPD, in the first half of 2024, the viewership of Chinese content in Video On Demand (VOD) platforms in Southeast Asia surpassed that of American dramas, making it the second-largest category of entertainment content for local audiences. Additionally, on freemium platforms, Chinese content has experienced rapid growth, accounting for 40% of viewership and significantly outpacing South Korean dramas. The backdrop for these revelations was the Asia TV Forum & Market (ATF), a vibrant hub where industry leaders converge to analyze trends, share insights, and chart the future of media and entertainment (M&E). It was here that Hou Xiaonan engaged in a significant dialogue with Orina Zhao, Research Manager at Ampere Analysis, on the theme of \"The Changing Landscape of China's M&E Industry.\" He articulated how Yuewen is a formidable force driving this trend and revealed the multifaceted strategies that underscore Yuewen's rising prominence on the global stage. Differentiated Content Operation Model from Hollywood & Value Proposition in China's M&E Industry In contrast to Hollywood's traditional, offline-oriented film and television model, Yuewen operates within a digital-first framework. This comprehensive ecosystem includes online literature, comics, animation, audiobooks, film and television, games, and merchandise, creating a robust digital entertainment industry cluster. \"Online literature and comics serve as the cornerstone and origin of our IPs,\" Hou explained. \"Our animation, film and television sectors transform these narratives into visual representations, while the combination of games, derivatives, and collectible cards acts as the linchpin of the commercialization process, enhancing the overall value of our IPs.\" Hou Xiaonan, CEO and President of Yuewen and Vice President of Tencent's Platform and Content Group at ATF Hou emphasized that Yuewen embodies two intertwined values within the M&E industry: being a prolific content producer and a full-chain IP value creator. With a vibrant community of over 10 million online writers and more than 16 million literary works, Yuewen continuously generates and identifies high-quality content based on user feedback, which is essential for successful IP adaptation. In 2024, four out of the top five most-viewed online drama series in China were produced by Yuewen or adapted from its IPs. Internationally, the company's films and IP-adapted dramas are making a significant impact. To name just a few, in 2024 - YOLO, produced by Yuewen's subsidiary New Classics Media, was globally distributed by Sony Pictures and is the highest-grossing Chinese film overseas. Two of the top three Chinese dramas on TikTok were from Yuewen. Joy of Life Season 2 became the most-watched Chinese series on Disney+. It also ranked as the highest-rated Chinese television series of 2024 on MyDramaList. Joy of Life Season 2, The Legend of ShenLi, and The Tale of Rose, topped charts on streaming platforms like WETV, TrueID, MOA, and MONOMAX in multiple countries, including the United States, South Korea, Singapore, and Thailand. In the highly competitive market of South Korea, in particular, Yuewen's productions or adaptations of its IPs occupied four out of the top five spots on the series playback chart of the streaming platform MOA June this year. Building on this momentum, the much-anticipated Guardians of the Dafeng, starring Dylan Wang, is set to premiere on overseas platforms such as Viu, YouTube, Disney+, and Malaysia's national television. Future Aspirations: Building an Open Global Ecosystem and International Expansion Yuewen aspires to be not merely a content creator but also an architect of an open global and sustainable IP ecosystem. With over 23 acquired or incubated media and entertainment companies under its umbrella, Yuewen is often compared to a Disney-like IP powerhouse in China. Hou Xiaonan stated that Yuewen will promote the globalization of its full-chain IP industry model, focusing on two main directions: first, applying the model to overseas original IPs to help international writers in cultivate their IPs; second, bringing Chinese IPs to international markets through diverse content formats. To that end, Yuewen will accelerate the development of overseas original IPs in collaboration with partners in Southeast Asia, Europe, America, and Japan. To date, Yuewen has cultivated approximately 430,000 overseas original writers. In 2024, the number of adaptations of Yuewen's overseas original online literature is projected to double compared to the previous year. It is well known that once a film or TV shows gains popularity, it can become a catalyst for local tourism at its filming locations. To capitalize on the 'IP + cultural tourism' synergy, Yuewen has partnered with organizations such as the Swiss National Tourist Office and the Singapore Tourism Board. By leveraging Singapore as a strategic gateway for global expansion, Yuewen is intensifying efforts to create a diverse array of platforms that promote the worldwide proliferation of its IPs. Singapore will feature a vibrant lineup of offline activities, including the highly anticipated Yuewen Music Festival on December 28, 29, and 31 and Yuewen Global IP Awards. \"The potential of high-quality IPs to create value is limitless, offering numerous opportunities for integrated development,\" Hou Xiaonan stated. Yuewen has introduced hundreds of IP-themed products and established self-operated stores in major Chinese cities like Beijing, Hangzhou, Xi'an, and Nanchang, creating a tangible connection with consumers. Moving forward, the company plans to expand its offline channels internationally, offering even greater commercialization opportunities for its IPs.
