However, given ongoing geopolitical volatility, making the right technology investment decisions will be a key lever for business growth and competitive advantage. Forrester's (Nasdaq: FORR) research, The Top 10 Emerging Technologies In 2025, highlights new technologies that empower leaders to drive AI-led innovation while ensuring long-term resilience. The research categorizes the top 10 emerging technologies by their impacts over short-term, mid-term, and long-term benefits horizons to help enterprises and leaders prioritize their investments. An overview of the top findings is as follows: Emerging technologies that will offer significant benefits to enterprises within the next two years by balancing AI acceleration with security needs include: IoT security. As cyber threats increase, IoT security technologies will be critical to strengthening defenses for critical data and connected devices. Businesses with high technology integration will see the biggest benefits from IoT security. Synthetic data. New to Forrester's emerging technologies list this year, this technology enhances AI model training while improving trust and privacy. With regulators encouraging organizations to adopt synthetic data to minimize risk, industries including financial services, insurance, healthcare, and the public sector will benefit the most. Mid-term emerging technologies that will deliver benefits to enterprises in the next two to five years given their real-world complexity include: Agentic AI. The immediate potential of this technology is increased flexibility and adaptability to automate specific business processes. Although early examples of AI agents are promising and offer autonomous decision-making, this technology still requires stronger accuracy, trust, and coordination to become mainstream. GenAI for visual content. This technology is changing the way companies create and deploy photorealistic images, videos, and motion graphics. GenAI for visual content is poised to make the biggest impact in marketing, advertising, retail, and e-commerce sectors, delivering immersive and personalized preferences, and boosting consumer satisfaction. The emerging technology that will take at least five more years to deliver tangible value for enterprises: Humanoid robots. This is the first year that this emerging technology has appeared on the list. GenAI's rapid advancement and decreasing hardware costs are driving the advancement of humanoid robots \u2014 autonomous robots that resemble humans in appearance and functionality and are equipped with advanced sensors, AI, and actuators to perform tasks. However, challenges including high research and development costs, and complexities surrounding robot integration into existing workflows and infrastructure will hinder their widespread adoption. \"As AI becomes ubiquitous, business and technology leaders should prioritize investments that will deliver the greatest impact for their organizations in terms of driving business growth, innovation, and competitive advantage,\" said Sharyn Leaver, chief research officer at Forrester. \"Despite global uncertainty, AI's rapid acceleration will continue. Enterprises that strategically balance AI innovation with risk mitigation will be ones that successfully thrive and achieve sustainable growth.\" Resources: Register for a complimentary webinar to learn about Forrester's 10 top emerging technologies for 2025 and how these innovations apply across industries.

During Ecosperity Week in Singapore, the Foundation's partner ACEN Corporation, announced a new collaboration with GenZero, Keppel, and Mitsubishi Corporation and its subsidiary, Diamond Generating Asia, Limited, to advance the first CCCI pilot in the Philippines, while Verra, a nonprofit certification body that issues Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) for carbon reduction, officially approved the CCCI's methodology, the first of its kind. In addition, new analysis from The Rockefeller Foundation shows that supporting 60 projects by 2030 could unlock US$110 billion in public and private investment while preventing 9,900 early deaths and 640,000 lost workdays annually and generating 29,000 new permanent jobs. Ashvin Dayal, Senior Vice President, Power and Climate at The Rockefeller Foundation, said: \"Energy access and abundance define people's, community's, and country's futures. With electricity demand increasing around the world, The Foundation has been looking for ways to work with communities and countries as they make the best energy choices for their people. As more and more countries and communities choose to transition to clean energy sources, philanthropy has a unique role to play\u2014we can take risks where others cannot and catalyze momentum needed. The projects announced this week will do just that, offering real benefits for people living and working in these communities.\" Increasing access to clean energy technologies, which are now cheaper than coal power in most markets, improves the affordability of energy for households, communities, businesses, and governments, according to a recent report from the International Energy Agency. When paired with energy storage and smart grid technologies, renewables also deliver energy reliability and decrease dependence on volatile fossil fuel markets. In addition, studies have shown major public health gains from reduced air pollution from coal-fired plants, which is particularly significant for vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing respiratory or cardiovascular conditions. This Work in Action: CCCI aims to unlock market demand for transition credits while addressing the needs of vulnerable communities, creating new jobs, expanding access to affordable energy, driving economic growth opportunities, and improving public health, alongside enhancing climate resilience. Since 2022, The Rockefeller Foundation has invested over $10 million to identify eligible communities, build an ecosystem around transition credits for high integrity, and support pre-feasibility assessments. In 2023, The Rockefeller Foundation announced a new collaboration with ACEN Corporation, the listed energy platform of the Ayala Group, to explore leveraging carbon finance to replace its 246 MW South Luzon Thermal Energy Corporation (SLTEC) coal plant in the Philippines with clean power and battery storage, while supporting the livelihoods of workers affected by the plant's early transition. Fully replacing SLTEC with the same level of firm, reliable power can be achieved with 1000 megawatt (MW) of solar, 250 MW of wind, and 1000 MW of battery energy storage. ACEN, whose SLTEC plant was already scheduled for early retirement in 2040, is working to move this up to 2030 by leveraging CCCI's methodology. The Rockefeller Foundation currently has a portfolio of potential projects in several geographies across the Asia-Pacific region, with an overarching goal of supporting 60 asset owners with similar transitions by 2030. Announced during Ecosperity Week 2025 Investing in energy abundance solutions. The Rockefeller Foundation shared for the first time their initial estimates, undertaken by Catalyst Advisors, that support for 60 projects could help unlock US$110 billion in public and private investment, create US$21 billion in economic spillover, and generate approximately 29,000 net permanent jobs. These projects could also prevent 9,900 early deaths and 640,000 lost workdays a year and save consumers in emerging economies up to US$8.3 billion annually in power costs. The Rockefeller Foundation also announced a US$600,000 grant to the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM Limited) to support a Continuous Improvement Program on transition credits, which will develop a high-integrity threshold for this new asset class. This funding will also help ensure that the needs and rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities are taken into account when designing and implementing these markets.\"Today's progress update demonstrates that we are closer than ever to unlocking new benefits to people with credits that will help communities transition to clean, affordable energy. We are now focused on scaling this initiative and bringing dozens of such transactions to the market by 2030.\" \u2015 Dr. Joseph Curtin, Managing Director for Power and Climate at The Rockefeller Foundation Exploring a new partnership to advance the first pilot.Located in a region with the second highest unemployment rate in the Philippines, ACEN's SLTEC is located in the City of Batangas, where the population density is 31% higher than the national average and where by 2030 over 726,000 people live within a 20-kilometer radius of the plant. Leveraging the CCCI's methodology, ACEN is teaming up with GenZero, Keppel Ltd., and Mitsubishi Corporation and its subsidiary, Diamond Generating Asia, Limited, to explore a collaboration that would facilitate the early retirement of the SLTEC plant and replace it with clean and reliable energy.\"This partnership represents a milestone in our collective efforts to address the enormous challenges of the energy transition. By pioneering the Transition Credits mechanism, we are demonstrating a viable pathway for coal-dependent economies to transition sustainably. We hope this will serve as a catalyst for other coal plant owners to embark on their clean energy journey.\"\u2015 Eric Francia, President and CEO of ACEN Corporation Approval of the CCCI's methodology.Verra, the leading global carbon crediting standard, officially approved the CCCI's methodology, marking a significant milestone in the development of high-integrity transition credits. This approval paves the way for the first projects to generate high-integrity transition credits \u2013 with clear protections in place \u2013 from local job creation to energy access and essential social safeguards \u2013 to supports workers and communities affected by early coal plant closures. \"We need to rethink the very systems that are hurting people and the planet. Our new methodology empowers energy providers to make that shift in a way that doesn't leave workers or communities behind and doesn't inadvertently exacerbate energy poverty.\" \u2015 Mandy Rambharos, CEO of Verra About The Rockefeller Foundation The Rockefeller Foundation is a pioneering philanthropy built on collaborative partnerships at the frontiers of science, technology, and innovation that enable individuals, families, and communities to flourish. We make big bets to promote the well-being of humanity. Today, we are focused on advancing human opportunity and reversing the climate crisis by transforming systems in food, health, energy, and finance.
