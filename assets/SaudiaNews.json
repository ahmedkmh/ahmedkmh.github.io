Folk Song and Yangko jwplayer('myplayer1').setup({file: 'https://mma.prnasia.com/media2/2648137/video.mp4', image: 'https://mma.prnasia.com/media2/2648137/video.mp4?p=medium', autostart:'false', stretching : 'uniform', width: '512', height: '288'}); On the 14th day of the first lunar month, a group of international visitors arrived at the Northern Shaanxi Folk Song Museum. Wang Zhixing, a professional folk singer, started the cultural tour with his impromptu singing. Northern Shaanxi folk songs, with high-pitched tunes and lingering rhymes, have been sung for generations on this land. From work chants to love duets, from weddings and funerals to festivals and rituals, Northern Shaanxi folk songs are a true reflection of the people's emotions. In 2006, they were included in the first batch of China's National Intangible Cultural Heritage List. After listening to the song, a foreigner said: \"this song shows the beauty of China, I do not understand but can feel everything.\" At the Yulin Folk Art Research Institute, a group of artists are making final preparations for the 2025 National Yangko Performance Exhibition. Originated from the Ming and Qing dynasties, Shaanbei Yangko is an entertainment combined dance, opera performances and folk rituals for farmers in their leisure time, which shows the optimism of Loess Plateau people. In 2008, Northern Shaanxi Yangko was included in China's National Intangible Cultural Heritage List. There are not only Yangko teams from all over China, but folk art troupes from Bulgaria, Thailand, South Korea and Russia in Yulin Lantern Festival in 2025. This fusion of Eastern and Western cultures gave new life to the ancient Shaanxi Yangko. Foreigners commented: \"I like their performance and dancing, because it was amazing. The collective celebration of the Chinese New Year breaks the Western model of family-style festivals.\" By participating in Yangko parade, foreigners not only appreciated the charm of intangible cultural heritage, but also understood the deeper significance of cultural inheritance. \"The cultural self-confidence reflected in the eyes of performers lets us see 5,000 years of civilisation. I respect and love this culture\". From the soundscape of the Folk Song Museum to the immersive experience of street Yangko, Yulin has built cross-cultural bridges with intangible cultural heritage arts for friends at home and abroad. These leaping notes and dance steps are vivid Chinese New Year gift, as well as the code for the world to understand the culture on this land, injecting new era vitality into Northern Shaanxi intangible cultural heritage.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-03-24 09:20:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_priority": 1333464, "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/en_prnasisa.png", "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top"], "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": true}, {"article_id": "0ec2dd8da9181d5c5e6a45e101b05095", "title": "\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0654\u062d\u0645\u0631 \u064a\u0646\u0641\u0651\u0630 \u062a\u062c\u0631\u0628\u0629 \u0647\u0628\u0648\u0637 \u0637\u0627\u064a\u0654\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0655\u0633\u0639\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0633\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0644\u062b\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u064a - \u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0633\u0628\u0642", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSkFVX3lxTE5nVG9fYzdCOTBuMzdVTzM0NDJGZVlucU8tOXJBeDQtRnVFNEl5bUZiTk1UMko4aWhPaUFrSGY1eU9DY0tLeUtROF9B?oc=5", "keywords": null, "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0654\u062d\u0645\u0631 \u064a\u0646\u0641\u0651\u0630 \u062a\u062c\u0631\u0628\u0629 \u0647\u0628\u0648\u0637 \u0637\u0627\u064a\u0654\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0655\u0633\u0639\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0633\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0644\u062b\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u064a \u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0633\u0628\u0642\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f.. \u062a\u062c\u0631\u0628\u0629 \u0647\u0628\u0648\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0655\u0633\u0639\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u064a \u0644\u0627\u0655\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0636\u064a\u0629 Al Yaum Newspaper\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0655\u0633\u0639\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u064a \u0644\u0627\u0655\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0636\u0649 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0645 \u0627\u0655\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0641\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0654\u062e\u0628\u0627\u063124#\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0644\u0627\u0644_\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0654\u062d\u0645\u0631 \u064a\u062c\u0631\u064a \u062a\u062c\u0631\u0628\u0629 \u0647\u0628\u0648\u0637 \u0637\u0627\u064a\u0654\u0631\u0629 #\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0655\u0633\u0639\u0627\u0641_\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0647\u0628\u0637 #\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0645_\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u064a \u0635\u0631\u0627\u062d\u0629", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-03-24 09:19:31", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "source_id": "google", "source_priority": 14, "source_name": "Google News", "source_url": "https://news.google.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/google.png", "language": "arabic", "country": ["saudi arabia"], "category": ["top"], "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "f982f4ce90c727f4ac6c8b0545d88e8c", "title": "Consumers Association of Singapore Supports HomeMatch's Efforts to Elevate Renovation Industry Standards", "link": "https://en.prnasia.com/story/482780-0.shtml", "keywords": ["rlt", "orl", "hou", "pdt", "rrl"], "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "SINGAPORE, March 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) recently visited HomeMatch, a renovation platform, highlighting HomeMatch's dedication to connecting homeowners with trustworthy renovators and raising industry standards. From left to right: Melvin Yong, CASE President; Mervin Foo, HomeMatch Co-Founder; Pengjin Liu, HomeMatch Co-Founder; Dexter Tay, CASE Executive Director CASE's Support for Elevating Industry Standards Melvin Yong, President of CASE, shared on Facebook about CASE's ongoing efforts to raise renovation industry standards in collaboration with HomeMatch. He highlighted that since June 2024, HomeMatch has been assisting renovation businesses in applying for and attaining CaseTrust accreditation. To encourage more firms to adopt consumer-friendly safeguards under the CaseTrust Renovation schemes, CASE has introduced subsidies covering up to 80% of accreditation and consultancy costs, aiming to accredit 500 renovation contractors in the next 3 years. In his post, he expressed optimism about the partnership, stating, \"Looking forward to further strengthening this collaboration with HomeMatch to enhance standards and consumer confidence in the renovation industry.\" HomeMatch's Exclusive Collaboration with CaseTrust-Accredited Renovators HomeMatch exclusively features renovators who have achieved CaseTrust accreditation and maintain a minimum of 4-star reviews on neutral platforms. To enhance transparency, HomeMatch interviews and screens every single renovator on an individual level before onboarding them. As such, homeowners have access to detailed profiles, including introductory videos, reviews, and portfolios of past projects, enabling homeowners to make informed decisions. This stringent screening process ensures homeowners are introduced to reliable renovators. Precision Matching with The Most Suitable Renovators Unlike traditional platforms that match homeowners with firms, HomeMatch focuses on individual renovators, allowing for a personalised experience. HomeMatch's precision matching algorithm currently uses over 500 datapoints to find homeowners the most suitable renovators. For example, a homeowner may specify that they prefer a female, Mandarin-speaking renovator who can work within a budget of around $50,000. They may also seek someone with a proven track record in industrial-style homes, experience in pet-friendly designs, and expertise in maximising storage \u2014 all of which should be evident in the renovator's portfolio. Beyond these core requirements, the matched renovator could also possess additional qualities that align with the homeowner's priorities. For instance, being a pet owner herself and being the consultative and non-pushy type. Safest-Smartest Assurance: Supporting Homeowners Before, During, After Renovation HomeMatch's commitment to raising industry standards is exemplified through its Safest-Smartest Assurance, a suite of mechanisms that supports homeowners before, during, and after the renovation process:1. Before renovation, HomeMatch helps homeowners vet their contract to ensure fair practices, while a performance bond underwritten by NTUC Income provides 100% deposit protection.2.
