In 2023, the company announced its goal to become the World's leading IP design retail group. To achieve this ambition, MINISO has made significant strides in product innovation, store expansion, and brand building, cementing its leading position in the global retail market. Interest-Driven Strategy Brings IP Empowerment MINISO's founder Mr. Jack Ye has previously pointed out that changes in the global retail industry mean great opportunity for MINISO to become globally competitive and influential. Jack Ye, MINISO\u2019s Founder, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer As early as 2020, Mr. Jack Ye envisioned \"interest-driven consumption\" as a key to the brand's growth, predicting that fulfilling consumers' emotional needs and desire for self-expression will become the driving force of future consumption. MINISO has successfully led this trend globally as the pioneer of the 'Global IP Collection Store' innovative business model, by incorporating popular intellectual properties (IPs) into its products, store designs, and marketing. This approach strengthens the brand's emotional connection with users, addressing the rising demand for interest-driven consumption and enhancing its overall value proposition. Mr. Jack Ye further emphasized the idea of combining essential items with IP-themed non-essentials, a concept he refers to as 'essential + optional consumption'. MINISO aims to create a distinctive retail giant that focuses on quality retail while meeting the genuine needs of consumers. To date, under this strategic layout, MINISO has partnered with over 150 globally renowned IPs, including Harry Potter, Disney, Sanrio, Chiikawa, Barbie, Snoopy, and Zanmang Loopy, to create collections that have enjoyed significant popularity and generated impressive numbers. Global IP product sales exceeded 10 billion RMB, with more than 10,000 new IP products launched each year and cumulative sales of more than 800 million IP products. At the conference, MINISO officially announced that the MINISO and Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer Products to launch the Harry Potter inspired collection. The co-branded products will be launched globally across all MINISO sales channels from October 31. The collaboration had already launched successfully in Hong Kong, Irvine, and Jakarta, greeted with strong enthusiasm from fans and setting new sales records. Ada Dou, MINISO\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer, and Max Cao, Vice President and head of WBD Consumer Products, China Innovation drives MINISO's growth. By focusing on pleasing design, fun, and quality products, MINISO continues to push the boundaries of IP design innovation, centering its creative efforts in China while also leveraging design centers in Korea, Japan, and the USA to bring fresh ideas and products to a global audience. In the future, MINISO aims to support 100 Chinese IPs to go global and reach a worldwide consumer base. Beyond IP collaborations, MINISO's product innovation is reflected in its exploration of new categories. The brand has ramped up investments in research and development, expanding into areas such as pets and ACG besides plush toys, blind boxes, fragrances, and travel accessories. To swiftly turn innovative designs into quality products for the global market, MINISO is also continually enhancing its global supply chain and building strong partnerships with leading suppliers. Innovative Store Formats Flourish Worldwide The rise in IP product influence strongly relates to an innovative channel development. Through continuous innovation and optimization strategies, MINISO has expanded its footprint to over 111 countries and regions, operating 2,753 stores outside of mainland China. Furthermore, MINISO has implemented a seven-tier store format to meet diverse customer needs, including IP-themed experiences and product-focused scenarios. At the conference, MINISO officially introduced a new store format \u2013 MINISO IP LAND. Two days prior to the conference, on October 27th, MINISO opened the world's first scenario-based IP collection store, MINISO LAND, on East Nanjing Road in Shanghai, which achieved record-breaking sales in its first month of soft opening. Jeff Kou, Vice President and Chief Growth Officer of MINISO, said, \"As the highest-level store format of MINISO, the MINISO LAND Global Flagship Store not only embodies the brand's vision, but also marks the milestone of MINISO's global channel upgrade.\" Jeff Kou, MINISO\u2019s Vice President and Chief Growth Officer Additionally, MINISO has introduced another store format, MINISO FRIENDS, targeting Gen-Z customers. These themed stores, ranging from 600 to 800 square meters in size, focus on plush toys, blind boxes, pets, and ACG, fostering a culture of community and belonging for younger audiences. Growing with Users for a Better Future By leveraging IP innovations and channel upgrades, MINISO has strengthened its brand and built a deep emotional connection with over a billion users worldwide, transforming customers into users. According to Robin Liu, Senior Vice President and CMO of MINISO, the brand's mention rate and preference have grown significantly over the past two years compared to other brands in the category. As MINISO deepens its focus on user engagement, it has successfully unlocked greater user value, leading to increased brand value. This is evident in the steady rise of both average unit price and customer spend. The membership number also explains. As of now, MINISO has more than 100 million registered members in major markets around the world. The number of overseas members has increased by 63% since 2024. Robin Liu, MINISO\u2019s Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Moreover, MINISO has proactively undertaken social responsibilities to bring a positive social impact. In the past two years, the brand has invested in two 10 million RMB funds to support women through the Marriage and Maternity Incentive Scheme program and promote animal welfare through MINISO Pet Protection Foundation. Setting Sights on Global Dominance In the future, MINISO will continue to deepen its overseas expansion, creating more representative stores with innovative interactive devices and immersive experience to cater to younger customers. With an open and inclusive approach, MINISO is embracing the global market. The brand looks forward to partnering with global partners and consumers to spread the \"Joy Philosophy\" worldwide, allowing everyone to experience the allure of the MINISO brand.

Geek+, in collaboration with Intel, debuts Vision Only Robot Solution. As the world's first vision only robot solution equipped with the Intel Visual Navigation Modules, the Geek+ Vision Only Robot Solution not only possesses depth vision perception enabled by the Intel RealSense camera, but also features deep algorithmic innovations in V-SLAM positioning, composite detection networks, and robot following. This allows for highly accurate positioning, navigation, and obstacle avoidance, helping enterprises effectively cope with diverse and complex logistics scenarios while enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. Advancing Depth Vision Perception The Geek+ Vision Only Robot Solution is equipped with the Intel Visual Navigation Module, which integrates the Intel RealSense camera. This camera features a novel all-in-one design that enables all depth calculations to be performed directly within the device, resulting in low power consumption and independence from specific platforms or hardware. The Intel RealSense camera provides core support for various vision-based AI solutions, and when paired with a dedicated visual processor, it accelerates the machine learning process and shortens the deployment cycle of automation solutions. Thanks to the Intel RealSense camera, the Geek+ Vision Only Robot observes, understands, interacts with, and learns from the environment. By obtaining highly accurate and consistent depth data from the environment, it accurately recognizes and interacts with its surroundings. In addition to the camera, the Intel Visual Navigation Module also includes the Robotic Vision Hub, which contains components such as the Intel Core i7-1270P processor and connection modules. This provides reliable computational support for algorithms running on the Geek+ Vision Only Robot, including V-SLAM positioning, composite detection networks, and robot following, while enabling cloud-edge collaboration through high-speed networks. The Robotic Vision Hub of Intel Visual Navigation Module Collaborating to Drive Algorithmic Innovation for Smart Logistics Upgrades Building on the Intel Visual Navigation Module, Geek+ is working with Intel to engage in deep algorithmic innovation related to V-SLAM positioning, composite detection networks, and robot following: V-SLAM Positioning Algorithm: It fuses multi-sensor data and various visual feature elements to generate composite maps, such as point feature maps, line feature maps, object maps, and special area maps. It delivers highly reliable and precise positioning in complex and dynamic environments. Composite Detection Network: With both a traditional object detection network and a validation network, it processes detection data from multiple dimensions, thus enhancing accuracy and reducing the false detection rate. Robot Following: By integrating modules like personnel detection, re-identification, and visual target tracking, Geek+ has developed a flexible and efficient visual perception pipeline. Once the relative position between the target personnel and the AMR is determined, the local planning algorithm in Geek+'s self-developed RoboGo, a robotic standalone system, will enable autonomous obstacle avoidance, resulting in smooth AMR following of the target personnel. Leveraging the depth perception of the Intel Visual Navigation Module and the collaborative algorithmic innovation from both sides, the Geek+ Vision Only Robot ensures high precision and efficiency in environmental perception, positioning, and tracking. This facilitates logistics and warehousing service providers to drive the transformation toward smart logistics. The robots are expected to see widespread adoption in areas such as factory and warehouse transportation, helping customers build agile, digital, and intelligent supply chains. Solomon Lee, VP of Product from Geek+ stated: \"The Vision Only Robot Solution, developed in collaboration with Intel, effectively leverages the depth vision perception of the Intel RealSense camera. Together with the deep algorithmic innovations from both sides, it results in a boost in business growth and efficiency for customers, driving the digital and intelligent upgrade of smart logistics.\" Mark Yahiro, Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Ventures and the General Manager of the RealSense Business Unit at Intel Inc. within Intel's Corporate Strategy Office remarked: \"Highly accurate and consistent depth vision data is critical for AMR to achieve environmental perception, significantly influencing its performance in positioning, navigation, and obstacle avoidance. Through collaboration with Geek+, we are driving AMR innovations based on depth vision data, enabling logistics robots to deliver highly stable and accurate transport services in complex environments, thereby empowering agile, digital, and intelligent supply chains.\" Going forward, Geek+ will continue to strengthen its collaboration with Intel, driving technological innovations to develop more smart logistics solutions. This aims to empower our customers, unlock new quality productive forces in the logistics sector, and lead the future of smart logistics innovation.
