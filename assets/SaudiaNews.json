The Company reported total revenue of $5.27 million, representing a 15.5% decrease from $6.24 million in 2023. In August 2024, the Company declared a special cash dividend of $0.0013 per share, amounting to approximately $2.2 million, which was distributed to shareholders in September 2024. This move reflects the Company's commitment to delivering shareholder value while maintaining a solid financial position. Financial Highlights Total Revenue: $5.27 million in fiscal year 2024, a decrease of 15.5% from $6.24 million in 2023, primarily due to reduced revenue in a client who is engaged in live streaming business. However, increased revenue of $471,979 from other consultancy services partially offset the decline. Net Income: $1.49 million in 2024, representing a decrease of approximately 34.8% compared to $2.28 million in 2023, yet the Company remained profitable. Cash Dividend: In September 2024, the Company paid a one-time special cash dividend of approximately $2.2 million, reflecting its financial stability and ongoing commitment to shareholder returns.
