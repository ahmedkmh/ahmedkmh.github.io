The first implants of ShiraTronics neuromodulation therapy for Chronic Migraine have been completed in the United States and Australia, marking a new chapter in the company's efforts to develop innovative solutions for individuals impacted by this disabling condition. ShiraTronics device The RELIEV-CM2 Clinical Study will implant up to 148 patients across the United States and Australia to assess the long-term safety and potential efficacy of ShiraTronics implantable neuromodulation therapy. Unlike other approaches that primarily manage migraine symptoms, the ShiraTronics System is designed to provide preventive, sustained relief for those who experience 15 or more headache days per month and have not achieved success with other treatments. For many of the millions who live with the challenging effects of Chronic Migraine, this novel approach could represent a potential new therapy option. Dr. Sandeep Vaid was the first physician to implant the ShiraTronics System in the United States. \"Bringing this new therapy to patients represents an exciting step forward in migraine management. Chronic Migraine has a profound impact on people's lives, limiting daily activities and affecting overall well-being. This device offers a fresh approach that, based on early results, holds promise for improving how patients function day-to-day. It's a privilege to be part of this pivotal study and witness what this technology might mean for patients who have exhausted other options,\" said Dr. Vaid. Dr. Vaid is Board Certified in Pain Management, Neurology, and Brain Injury Medicine and serves as Medical Director of Clinical Research at Vista Clinical Research in Newnan, Georgia. Rising Demand for Long-Term Solutions for Chronic Migraine Migraine affects nearly 2% of the global population and is often marked by severe, pulsating headaches, sensory sensitivity, nausea, and fatigue. Patients with Chronic Migraine, a more severe form of migraine, experience headaches 15 or more days per month, with at least eight days accompanied by intense and disabling migraine symptoms. Despite available treatments\u2014such as prescription pills, CGRP inhibitors, and Botox injections\u2014millions of patients in the United States are unable to control the disease with current preventive treatment options and therefore continue to struggle with symptoms that significantly impact their quality of life, physical and emotional well-being, and productivity. This has highlighted an urgent need for alternative therapies that could provide more consistent and lasting relief. The ShiraTronics System was designed with this need in mind. By delivering targeted electrical impulses to key nerve pathways, the device is placed just beneath the skin and aims to relieve, interrupt and prevent migraine frequency and severity, potentially providing a new, non-pharmacologic option for those seeking a solution to Chronic Migraine's disabling effects. Limitations of Current Chronic Migraine Treatments Current migraine treatments primarily focus on managing symptoms, and some can lead to dependency, rebound headaches, or difficult side effects. Preventive options often require regular healthcare visits for injections, or repeatedly self-administering injections, which can disrupt patients' lives. Often patients find that these treatments fail to deliver adequate relief or result in side effects that hinder quality of life, making them challenging to continue. The ShiraTronics System aims to address these limitations by targeting the nerve pathways involved in Chronic Migraine with precise, 24/7 electrical neuromodulation. The goal is to provide an approach that can potentially reduce the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks, allowing patients to maintain their daily activities with fewer disruptions and less dependence on continuous medication or invasive treatments. Early Pilot Study Success The RELIEV-CM Pilot Study, an earlier study by ShiraTronics, provided encouraging initial insights. Among a cohort of 10 Chronic Migraine patients who had not responded to conventional treatments, 80% reported a 50% reduction in migraine frequency after three months, with some experiencing reduced severity as well. Additionally, 60% of participants reported decreased reliance on acute medications, with several discontinuing them within the first six months of therapy. \"The minimally invasive nature of this procedure allows us to implant the device efficiently, making the procedure easily adopted by implanting physicians. The initial results we've seen have been very promising, and the procedure itself has been both straightforward and well-received by patients. I'm honored to contribute to the development of a therapy that could offer sustainable benefits for those living with persistent, treatment-resistant migraines,\" said Associate Professor Marc Russo, an internationally recognized leader in neuromodulation and Immediate Past-President of the International Neuromodulation Society (INS). Associate Professor Russo also serves as Director at Large of the Neuromodulation Society of Australia and New Zealand (NSANZ). Looking Ahead: Moving Migraine Research Forward As the RELIEV-CM2 Clinical Study progresses, ShiraTronics is collaborating closely with healthcare professionals and patients to evaluate the long-term safety and potential of its neuromodulation therapy. The company is focused on advancing this technology aiming to improve patient outcomes, with the intention of making this innovative approach widely available to Chronic Migraine patients in the future. While still in the early stages, the study underscores the potential impact of the ShiraTronics System for those who have exhausted traditional treatment options. \"Our mission is to provide a new therapy option for chronic migraine patients that will reduce the impact of migraine, restore functionality and improve quality of life,\" said Fred Ecklund, VP Global Clinical Affairs. About ShiraTronics ShiraTronics, a Minneapolis-based, privately-held medical device innovator, is at the forefront of neuromodulation solutions to transform the lives of those suffering from Chronic Migraine.

selected to brand and operate hotels and serviced residences in the upcoming Islamic World District (IWD) area of Knowledge Economic City (KEC), a 6.8 million square meter mixed-use project in the holy city of Madinah. As one of the leading Master Developers in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, KEC is delivering over 18,000 hospitality rooms that will further strengthen Madinah's importance in the travel industry by significantly improving its tourism offerings, capacity and the pilgrim experience, all key elements of Saudi Vision 2030. Above: Signing Between Archipelago and Knowledge Economic City in Madinah Aston Hotel & Residences KEC will consist of 519 hotel rooms and 130 serviced apartments within the IWD area of KEC and will open in 2027. This district aims to maximize its proximity to Haramain railway station, which links Madinah to Makkah and Jeddah by high-speed train, and provides integrated services for pilgrims and visitors from the multiple cultures of the Islamic world. It will reflect these cultures in the facilities and services offered including hotels, shops, restaurants, entertainment outlets, medical clinics and other support services. Archipelago is the largest privately owned operator of hotels in Southeast Asia, a key region for pilgrim travel and a region which is widely recognized as a high growth area for outbound tourism generally. Its Aston brand is the leading hotel brand in Indonesia with a history of over 27 years in that market. \"The importance of Indonesia as a tourism source market for Madinah, Makkah, Saudi Arabia and the wider GCC region cannot be overstated. With over 50% of Indonesia's population under the age of 30, a growing middle class, consistent improvements in airlift and the rising influence of social media, Indonesia has the greatest capacity for outbound growth and pilgrim travel than any other Muslim nation.

About Islamic World District The Islamic World District (IWD) is a landmark project strategically located in the southeastern part of Knowledge Economic City, adjacent to the Haramain High-Speed Rail Station in Madinah. Spanning an area of 1 million square meters, the project is designed to align with two key programs of Saudi Vision 2030: the Pilgrim Experience Program and the Quality of Life Program. The IWD aims to support the Pilgrim Experience Program by enhancing the experience of pilgrims, Umrah visitors, and tourists through high-quality hospitality and services, ease of access to the holy sites, and enriching their religious and cultural journey. Additionally, it supports the Quality of Life Program by offering vibrant urban centers, family entertainment facilities, live performances, theaters, exhibitions, and festivals. The project's primary objectives include the development of permanent residential accommodations, hospitality facilities, and comprehensive support services such as a visitor reception center, cultural and social squares, diverse retail outlets, clinics, pedestrian pathways, green spaces, event areas, and an interactive Seerah Museum. The district's architectural design draws inspiration from Islamic heritage, replicating styles from various Islamic countries to create a unique cultural and aesthetic experience. Upon completion, IWD will feature approximately 18,000 hotel rooms, addressing the shortage of accommodation in Madinah and meeting the strategic goals of the Pilgrim Experience Program. The project will also cater to the Kingdom's ambitious target of increasing the number of pilgrims, Umrah visitors, and tourists to 30 million annually. Connected by environmentally friendly transportation options, IWD is poised to become a vital hub that integrates religious, cultural, and recreational experiences in Madinah.", "content": "ONLY

Over the year, 1,000 phishing URLs were tested in four quarterly evaluations to measure the effectiveness of antivirus programs and web browsers in defending against phishing attacks. Avast and McAfee emerged as top performers, each achieving an impressive 95% detection rate, though McAfee had a higher number of false alarms. Link to test report: https://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/gen_phishing_11-2024.pdf The tests were conducted using the latest versions of antivirus software on a standard computer to evaluate their ability to detect phishing websites while avoiding false positives on legitimate ones. Products tested included Avast Free Antivirus, Bitdefender Total Security, ESET HOME Security Essential, F-Secure Internet Security, G Data Total Security, Kaspersky Standard, Malwarebytes Premium, McAfee Total Protection, Microsoft Defender, and Trend Micro Internet Security. Web browsers such as Avast Secure Browser, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera were also evaluated. In the final quarterly test of 2024, which used 250 phishing URLs, Avast achieved the highest detection rate at 95%. Bitdefender, Kaspersky, McAfee, and Trend Micro also delivered strong results, demonstrating robust anti-phishing capabilities. Over the course of the year, Avast and McAfee maintained exceptional consistency, each achieving a 95% detection rate overall. G Data and Kaspersky also performed admirably, with scores exceeding 90%. McAfee's performance, however, was slightly impacted by a higher rate of false positives compared to other top performers. Phishing remains one of the most widespread cyber threats, using deceptive websites to steal sensitive information such as passwords, financial details, and personal data. These attacks can result in significant financial losses, identity theft, and malware infections. The insights from AV-Comparatives' phishing protection tests help consumers and businesses choose reliable solutions to reduce these risks effectively.
