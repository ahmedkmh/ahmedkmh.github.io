Event in 2024", "link": "https://en.prnasia.com/story/486974-0.shtml", "keywords": ["spe", "sse", "fas", "hou", "rea", "spt"], "creator": null, "description": "XIAMEN, China, April 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- With the increasing popularity of healthy lifestyles and the widespread promotion of fitness, the global athletic footwear and apparel market continues to expand, driven by rising consumer demand for high-performance running products. In 2024, the global running shoe market reached $51.3 billion. The growth of this sector is primarily fueled by the following factors -- rising health awareness and mass adoption of Marathons races. As there is a growing emphasis on health and fitness, it has encouraged more consumers to engage in running, driving demand for professional running shoes, functional sportswear, and related accessories. Furthermore, the increasing participation in marathons and road running events has significantly expanded the market for performance running shoes and running gear, with athletes showing a growing preference for high-performance footwear and smart wearable devices. Among all sportswear brands, Chinese sportswear brands have gained increasing recognition in global markets, transitioning from regional players to internationally competitive brands. With the global rise of Chinese trend culture, overseas consumers have shown growing awareness and demand toward the fashion-forward designs, high value-for-money, and deep cultural elements embedded in Chinese brands. Chinese sports brands have strengthened their global presence through strategic initiatives such as collaborating with international ambassadors, sponsoring major sporting events, and expanding global sales channels. These efforts have significantly enhanced brand influence on the international stage. Meanwhile, leading Chinese sports brands such as Li-Ning, ANTA, and Xtep have ramped up investments in product research and development, technological innovation, and sustainable materials, enabling them to deliver internationally competitive products with superior performance, comfort, and quality. As consumer preferences evolve, a growing number of international buyers are choosing Chinese brands, further solidifying their global market share and accelerating their transition towards premiumization and internationalization. Chinese sports brands have also increased their presence in national marathon events, with domestic running shoes demonstrating growing stability in professional races and significantly higher adoption rates among athletes. Meanwhile, marathon participation has surged across China, with both event numbers and scale expanding in parallel. In 2024, China hosted 749 road races of various levels, attracting over 7.04 million participants, reflecting the growing mass adoption and regional expansion of marathon events in the country. As marathon participation rises, demand for professional running gear continues to escalate, with performance running shoes, moisture-wicking apparel, and GPS smartwatches becoming essential for runners. This trend has not only driven the expansion of the performance running gear market but also fueled continuous advancements in running shoe design and technology. Runners and marathon participants now form a key consumer segment, with their increasing demand serving as a crucial driver of market growth. Sports brands play a pivotal role in marathon sponsorship, with running shoes being highly aligned with marathon event content, making them a natural fit for sports marketing initiatives. The broad exposure and high engagement levels in marathon events provide sports brands with greater visibility and stronger marketing effectiveness. As a result, marathon events have become a critical marketing battleground for sports brands, further strengthening brand recognition and competitiveness in the performance sportswear market.
