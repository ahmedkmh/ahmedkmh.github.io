Launched in celebration of Singapore's 60th anniversary (SG60), this milestone offering leverages the nation's dual strengths as a global financial centre and a leading gold hub. SINGAPORE, Nov. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Lion Global Investors (LGI), a member of the OCBC Group today announced the launch of the LionGlobal Singapore Physical Gold Fund, Singapore's first physical gold fund that is insured and securely vaulted in Singapore. Distributed to retail investors by OCBC, MariBank Singapore, Great Eastern and Singlife Group, and with Standard Chartered Bank Singapore appointed as the fund's custodian, this landmark initiative marks the first time a consortium of leading players from Singapore's financial sector has come together to launch a flagship physical gold fund. The partnership underscores a shared commitment to elevating Singapore's standing as a leading gold hub. Amid growing geopolitical uncertainty, gold continues to be viewed as a reliable safe haven asset. While traditional trading hubs like New York and London remain influential, the global gold market has been steadily shifting eastward[1]. Positioned near 25% of the world's gold mining supply[2], Singapore offers both geopolitical neutrality and strategic geographic proximity, making it well-placed to emerge as a leading gold hub. The launch of the LionGlobal Singapore Physical Gold Fund builds on these strengths, reinforcing Singapore's dual roles as a global financial centre and a leading gold hub. [1] CNBC, 11 June 2024: Singapore is set to lead the gold market as centre of gravity shifts east [2] The Reserve Singapore, 22 November 2024: Singapore's Rise as a Leading Gold Hub The LionGlobal Singapore Physical Gold Fund seeks to track the performance of London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) Gold Price* AM as closely as possible. The fund will invest in LBMA Good Delivery gold which is compliant with LBMA Good Delivery Rules and fully safekept in Singapore. * LBMA GOLD PRICE IS A TRADE MARK OF PRECIOUS METALS PRICES LIMITED, IS LICENSED TO ICE BENCHMARK ADMINISTRATION LIMITED (IBA) AS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE LBMA GOLD PRICE, AND IS USED BY LION GLOBAL INVESTORS LIMITED WITH PERMISSION UNDER LICENCE BY IBA. The fund provides investors with access to physical gold, underpinned by secure vaulting, insured protection, and seamless digital accessibility. As the first of its kind in Singapore, this launch marks a pivotal moment in positioning the nation as a leading gold hub, offering both local and international investors the opportunity to invest in gold physically stored within Singapore. \"By anchoring the fund in Singapore and partnering with trusted institutions, the LionGlobal Singapore Physical Gold Fund represents a bold step forward in making physical gold investment more accessible, secure, and relevant for today's investors,\" said Teo Joo Wah, Chief Executive Officer, Lion Global Investors. \"We are thrilled to be launching the LionGlobal Singapore Physical Gold Fund, which addresses growing demand for alternative assets in diversified portfolios, particularly in volatile markets where gold continues to serve as a trusted store of value. By leveraging multiple avenues from digital banking to insurance platforms, the fund also ensures accessibility for a broader investor base, from institutional clients to everyday savers seeking inflation hedges and long-term wealth preservation,\" Mr Teo added. Launch anchors of the LionGlobal Singapore Physical Gold Fund While the LionGlobal Singapore Physical Gold Fund is open to Singapore-based investors, its launch is anchored by a consortium of leading players from Singapore's financial sector that play a pivotal role in its development and distribution. These strategic partners bring deep expertise and infrastructure to support the Fund's success. Teo Joo Wah, CEO, Lion Global Investors: \"We are proud to lead this initiative that not only democratises access to physical gold but also unites a visionary group of partners who are contributing to Singapore's success as a financial and gold hub.

As a leading wealth management player, we are constantly curating quality investment solutions that align with our customers' aspirations to enable them to strengthen their investment portfolios and preserve their wealth.\" As the anchor digital bank partner, MariBank plays a key role in broadening access to Singapore's first physical gold fund by making gold investment available at as low as S$1. Through its secure and intuitive digital platform, MariBank enables seamless fund participation for retail investors, making gold investment more accessible than ever. Natalia Goh, MariBank Singapore CEO: \"MariBank is proud to be a key member of this gold consortium, leading the charge to make gold investment simpler and more inclusive. Starting from just S$1, customers can now invest in a trusted asset that helps them hedge and build resilience in uncertain times. This reflects our broader mission to make financial services simple, reliable, and rewarding for everyone.\" As pioneering insurance partners in Singapore's first physical gold fund, Great Eastern and Singlife are setting a new benchmark by incorporating physical gold into their offerings and breaking new ground through their commitment to offer it as part of their Investment-Linked Policies (ILP) programmes. This strategic integration not only broadens access to alternative investment options for the insurance segment but also underscores their dedication to financial empowerment and building innovative, future-ready solutions. \"Long term wealth planning remains a key priority for our customers and I believe will continue to be viewed as a steady hedge especially for individuals approaching retirement and those seeking stability in a diversified portfolio. As a homegrown insurer, we are aligned with Lion Global Investor's strategic direction in bringing this Gold Fund to market as a compelling option to preserve wealth,\" said Greg Hingston, Group CEO, Great Eastern. \"Singlife's partnership with LGI on the LionGlobal Singapore Physical Gold Fund reflects our commitment to providing innovative solutions as we help customers find a better way to financial freedom,\" said Allen Kuo, Chief Investment Officer at Singlife. \"As part of this collaboration, we're offering advisers and customers access to this unique class of assets through our ILPs and investment platforms, GROW with Singlife and dollarDEX.

Additionally, the Bank serves as the trustee and functions as both the fund administrator and transfer agent. Francois Verlaine, Regional Head of Financing and Securities Services for ASEAN & South Asia, Standard Chartered: \"We are very excited to play a pivotal role with our partners in elevating Singapore's position to be the leading financial centre in Asia with the launch of Singapore's first insured and Singapore-vaulted physical gold fund.
