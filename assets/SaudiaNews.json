JD.com's global headquarters campus, located in Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, spans over 30 hectares with a total floor area exceeding 2 million square meters, representing a modern office community that integrates technological sophistication with human-centric design. During the visit, the delegation gathered before the detailed architectural model of JD.com's headquarters campus. The model demonstrates JD.com's headquarters cluster and its global office network planning, highlighting the worldwide strategic vision and development framework of this technology leader. The delegation then proceeded to the cultural exhibition hall, where integrated light-shadow technology and physical displays vividly trace JD.com's evolution from a small counter in Zhongguancun to a Fortune Global 500 company. Throughout its journey, JD.com has not only witnessed China's rapid economic development but has also emerged as an exemplary representative of balancing innovation and corporate responsibility in the digital era. Christophe de Contenson, Mayor of Couzon in France's Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes, remarked that JD.com's headquarters is as magnificent as a city, with equally impressive operational scale and business volume. The delegation then came to the \"JD Today\" big data screen in the JD Vision exhibition zone. On the screen, real-time transaction data is dynamically visualized through heat maps and product category sales rankings, clearly outlining national consumption hotspots and trends. The entire process vividly showcased JD Logistics' operational efficiency and the vibrant dynamism of China's consumer economy. During the post-tour exchange session, JD.com executives systematically presented the corporation's comprehensive profile and the business layout of JD Global Sales. Since its inception in 2015, the business has expanded to over 100 countries and regions, introducing more than 20,000 overseas brands. Through innovative models and leveraging its digital-intelligent supply chain with nearly 90 bonded and overseas warehouses, JD Global Sales is committed to building efficient pathways for international brands to access the Chinese market. In 2025, JD.com ranked 44th on the Fortune Global 500 list and secured 10th place on the 2025 list of the top 500 Chinese enterprises.

Key highlights of week one included dialogues on ecosystem restoration, financing mechanisms for climate resilience, and public-private partnerships that align national and regional goals. YB Dato\u2019 Sri Huang Tiong Sii, Deputy Minister of Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability delivering his opening speech for the opening of Week 2 at the Malaysia Pavilion and the launch of NDC 3.0 in the presence of local and international delegates at COP30 The Pavilion's early-week energy carried through a strong showing of thought leadership, showcasing Malaysia's capacity to convene diverse voices to advance shared regional priorities. Building on these discussions, week two of COP30 deepens focus on collaboration, innovation, and actionable frameworks. Malaysia's agenda will centre on just transitions, nature-based solutions, and sustainable financing to ensure that regional aspirations translate into concrete results. As Malaysia enters week two of COP30, the Pavilion continues to serve as a collaborative platform where government, industry, academia, civil society and youth exchange insights and forge pathways toward low-carbon growth. Anchored by the theme \"Climate Action Now: Net Zero Pathways Unlocked,\" the Pavilion showcases Malaysia's efforts to integrate sustainability across national development. Reflecting on Malaysia's aspirations for the second week, Deputy Minister of Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability (NRES), Dato' Sri Huang Tiong Sii, said, \"Our theme speaks to the many pathways already taking shape across Malaysia, from renewable energy expansion to nature-based solutions and sustainable urban development. Each of these pathways reflects our collective effort to translate sustainability into real, lasting impact for people and the planet. As the world convenes here in Bele\u0301m to review progress and share lessons, Malaysia's approach remains consistent to integrate sustainability into every dimension of national development through collaboration, knowledge and community empowerment.\" Malaysia continues to cement its leadership in advancing regional climate collaboration. Building on the momentum from its ASEAN Chairmanship in 2025 and its progress at COP30, Malaysia has laid strong foundations for harmonising carbon market standards, strengthening nature-based solutions frameworks, and safeguarding transboundary ecosystems. As the Chairmanship transitions to the Philippines, this continuity of vision and commitment remains intact ensuring that regional cooperation stays aligned, ambition is translated into tangible outcomes, and Southeast Asia remains a driving force in shaping global climate solutions The updated target is aligned with Malaysia's Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LTLEDS), the 13th Malaysia Plan (RMK-13) and the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), ensuring that near-term actions reinforce Malaysia's long-term aspiration to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. NDC 3.0 also strengthens Malaysia's adaptation planning by outlining climate risks, sectoral priorities and resilience strategies in line with the Paris Agreement's enhanced transparency requirements. Throughout the week, the Pavilion will also host Networking Sessions, Project Presentations and Fireside Chats, facilitating partnerships between government agencies, private sector stakeholders, and international organisations. The Malaysia Pavilion at COP30 is spearheaded by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability (NRES), implemented by the Malaysian Green Technology and Climate Change Corporation (MGTC), and supported by leading national strategic partners, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) and Maybank.
