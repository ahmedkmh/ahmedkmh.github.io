Co-hosted by Xtep and Standard Chartered, the camp commenced at 5:00 a.m. at Hoang Mai Stadium. The Standard Chartered Heritage Marathon Hanoi X-RUN CAMP The Standard Chartered Heritage Marathon Hanoi has established itself as one of Vietnam's premier running events, attracting nearly 2,000 international athletes from close to 60 countries annually. Known for its challenging course and humid conditions, the race demands a high level of endurance and pacing strategy\u2014placing significant responsibility on its official pacers, who must maintain precise timing under variable circumstances. \"The professionalism and reliability of pacers are crucial to the event's integrity and every runner's experience,\" emphasized Assoc. Prof. Dr. Nguyen Tri\u2013Chief Executive Officer, DHA Vietnam. \"They are not just pace-setters; they are leaders on the course\" Now in its seventh consecutive year as the event's official apparel sponsor, Xtep was entrusted by the organizing committee to launch the inaugural SCHM X-RUN CAMP\u2014a decision that underscores the brand's proven commitment and expertise in advancing Vietnam's running ecosystem. The Exciting Training Moments of the Pacers The SCHM X-RUN CAMP was designed specifically for the event's official pacers and 50 elite runners, providing them with a comprehensive training experience. The camp equipped participants with professional coaching, race-simulated environments, and high-performance footwear from the 160X, 260X, and 360X series. Through tailored programs\u2014including running form drills and 1,000-meter interval sessions\u2014participants refined their rhythm control and energy management strategies. The camp's intensive curriculum was designed to help pacers stabilize their pacing and build race-day confidence, enabling them to deliver more accurate and dependable guidance to the broader running community. By integrating cutting-edge equipment with specialized training, Xtep elevated the competency of the official pacing team, reinforcing the marathon's international stature as a professionally driven event. The training moments of the XRC runners in Haiphong, Vietnam Throughout October, Xtep Vietnam is also collaborating with the XRC running community to host three joint routine training sessions across Vietnam's key regions: Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh, and Haiphong. These sessions, integrated into the XRC's regular training schedule, are open to all registered participants of The Standard Chartered Heritage Marathon Hanoi and feature professional guidance combined with experience in Xtep's high-performance footwear, including the 160X 7.0. Designed to help runners build stamina, refine strategy, and push toward new personal bests, the initiative extends Xtep's professional running support beyond specialized camps and into the community's ongoing training rhythm. The successful launch of the first-ever SCHM X-RUN CAMP in Vietnam underscores the brand's commitment to deepening its roots in the local running community. This initiative not only builds momentum for the Hanoi Marathon on November 9 but also reflects Xtep's strategic focus on nurturing running culture at the grassroots level in key Southeast Asian markets. As more runners join the XRC training initiatives, the energy surrounding the event and the performance level of participants are expected to climb. The Xtep XRC community will continue to serve as a key platform for connection and growth among Vietnamese runners, pushing the sport toward a more performance-driven and community-focused future through structured training and shared resources. As part of its continued engagement, Xtep invites all running enthusiasts to visit its booth at the Hanoi Marathon Expo from November 7 to 9, where the brand will showcase its professional running products and host interactive sessions with KOLs and athletes. Attendees can also participate in daily lucky draws to win practical accessories like socks and bags, with a chance to receive a pair of the high-performance 160X 7.0 running shoes.
