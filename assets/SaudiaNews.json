The fund seeks to provide a platform for collaborative philanthropy and shared learning, while catalysing conservation action in one of the world's most biodiverse marine regions. This initiative comes at a critical juncture as world leaders gather to evaluate the implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which includes the ambitious target of conserving at least 30% of the world's land, freshwater, and ocean by 2030. At COP16, governments are urged to act together with urgency to meet the 30x30 target as they are significantly falling short of that pledge. To date, just four out of 11 Southeast Asian countries have joined the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People, an inter-governmental coalition that aims to deliver upon this target. With less than 3% of the region's national waters under formal protection, the 30x30 Southeast Asia Ocean Fund, co-chaired by Rumah Foundation and Oceankind and managed by Asia Community Foundation, aims to contribute towards the protection of 30% of Southeast Asia's seas by 2030. \"Ocean philanthropy stands at a pivotal crossroads, urgently calling for funders to unite in addressing the critical challenges facing marine ecosystems.\" said Kathlyn Tan, Director of Rumah Foundation. \"With the region home to approximately a third of the world's coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangroves, Southeast Asia's marine biodiversity is remarkable both regionally and globally. By supporting the 30x30 goal, funders can play a vital role in safeguarding the livelihoods of millions and the ecosystems that sustain them, while also contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation.\" The 30x30 Southeast Asia Ocean Fund has three core objectives: Create new marine protected and conserved areas. Expand coverage of existing marine protected and conserved areas. Strengthen the effective management of existing marine protected and conserved areas. The fund's approach will extend beyond traditional Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to include other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs), Indigenous and Traditional Territories (ITTs), Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMAs), and other relevant designations. As a region home to millions who rely on ocean-based livelihoods and some of the world's most biodiverse hotspots, it is essential that Southeast Asia scales marine protection equitably, ensuring people-centred conservation approaches that benefit Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Mariko Powers, Program Officer at Oceankind, emphasised the importance of local engagement: \"Southeast Asia is a critically important region to advance equitable and effective ocean conservation. We believe that investing in local capacity to drive ocean protection is key to achieving 30x30, and that the Impact Fund represents an incredible opportunity to channel resources to impactful projects, civil society champions, and strong local organisations toward these ends.\" The fund is now open for expressions of interest from local actors and conservation practitioners across the region. We also invite regional and global funders to join this vital initiative, reinforcing our collective commitment to a sustainable future for our ocean.

evaluate and develop business opportunities for low-carbon chemicals produced exclusively with renewable energy, and the corresponding value chains in India. From left: Gautam Reddy K, CEO, AM Green Ammonia; Mahesh Kolli, Group President, AM Green; Dr. Markus Kamieth, Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE and Alexander Gerding, Managing Director, BASF India and Head, BASF Group Companies India. Dr. Markus Kamieth, Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE, and Mahesh Kolli, Group President of AM Green, signed the agreement in the context of the Asia-Pacific Conference of German Business 2024 hosted in New Delhi, India. Under the MoU, BASF and AM Green intend to conduct feasibility studies on low-carbon chemicals production in India including a joint evaluation of potential technologies. The cooperation also includes a non-binding letter of intent for the offtake of 100,000 tons annually of ammonia produced exclusively with renewable energy including energy from pumped storage projects from AM Green's plants in different locations in India. This ammonia will meet EU standards for renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO) as defined in the Renewable Energy Directive (RED III). Some of AM Green's facilities have already been pre-certified for RFNBO compliance through the CertifHyTM voluntary certification scheme. Pre-certification for AM Green's other facilities is currently underway. \"We are committed to the sustainable transformation of the industries we serve. We are convinced that India is the right place to explore low-carbon chemical production together with our partner AM Green,\" said, Dr. Markus Kamieth, Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE. Mahesh Kolli, Group President of AM Green, said, \"We are delighted to partner with a global chemical leader like BASF to propel the green transformation in the industry. AM Green's vision of deepening capabilities in downstream value chains of green molecules is core to this partnership with BASF. AM Green and BASF partnership envisages to cater to multiple chemical downstream and associated consumer industries by providing key green molecule feedstocks to produce chemicals, materials and products in the markets served by BASF.\" About BASF: At BASF, we create chemistry for a sustainable future.
