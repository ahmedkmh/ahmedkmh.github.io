Cable Tracker, the flexible tracking system, characterized by its \"large span and high ground clearance,\" further enhances suitability for scenarios like mountainous areas and agrivoltaics. SkyLineII Solar Tracker The \"Green Power+\" solution displayed diverse applications on-site, including energy storage systems(ESS), building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), and integrated PV-storage-charging carports. This showcased Arctech's cutting-edge exploration in multi-scenario \"PV+\" integration and synergistic energy management, offering end-users in Australia one-stop clean energy solutions. Arcbank Utility-scale energy storage system In active response to Australia's \"Clean Recovery\" plan, Arctech completed the signing of several key strategic cooperation agreements during the event. These agreements aim to comprehensively deepen its local footprint, spanning from product solution standards and localized services to talent development.
