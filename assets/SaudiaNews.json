and Singapore's first 60KM national ultra marathon, the fourth edition marks a bold new chapter for Singapore's wellness movement SINGAPORE, May 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Glow Festival by Prudential 2025 returns from 5 to 13 July 2025, transforming Marina Bay Sands Event Plaza into Singapore's epicentre of modern wellbeing. In its fourth edition, Glow steps into a powerful new role, reimagining wellness as a multi-sensory, deeply human experience for everybody and every stage of life. Glow Festival by Prudential 2025 This year's theme, Dynamic Vibes, signals a bold invitation: to move with intention, feel with honesty, and live with greater awareness. From mental health and emotional resilience to movement, music and recovery, Glow Festival by Prudential 2025 champions a vision of wellness that is expansive, culturally grounded, and joyful. As Presenting Sponsor, Prudential Singapore (\"Prudential\") will launch Every Body Club, a new initiative designed to empower individuals from various walks of life to take proactive steps toward managing their physical, emotional and financial wellbeing. Glow Festival by Prudential 2025 will serve as the anchor event for this nationwide initiative. For the first time, Glow's programme expands to spotlight a broader spectrum of health topics, from Traditional Chinese Medicine and fertility to oral health, menopause, nervous system health, and emotional regulation. By putting these conversations centre stage, Prudential Singapore aims to raise awareness around holistic wellbeing and strengthen its promise to provide meaningful support to customers when they need it most. Belinda Tan, Head of Marketing & Events, Prudential Singapore, said, \"We are committed to empowering individuals to proactively take care of their health. As the Presenting Sponsor of Glow Festival, we are delighted to bring in experts covering a wide range of health and wellness topics, inviting festival-goers to discover the essence of living well. Furthermore, with the launch of our wellness initiative, Every Body Club, we aim to build a strong foundation of holistic wellbeing and be trusted partners for our customers in the long term.\" Mr Martin Capstick, Founder, Glow Festival, shared, \"This year is about meeting people where they are and helping them connect with what matters most: movement, presence, and meaning. We have expanded the festival to reflect the full spectrum of wellbeing. Whether you're here for strength training, healing workshops, or deeper dialogue around mental and emotional health, you'll find space to grow.\" Ms Lilian Chee, Director, Sports, Singapore Tourism Board, said, \"Now in its fourth edition, the Glow Festival has established itself as a key homegrown event that strengthens Singapore's position as a leading urban wellness destination through innovative and diverse programming. Together with committed partners, the festival consistently delivers quality experiences for both locals and visitors, adding vibrancy to Singapore's leisure events calendar.\" What's New: Energy, Empathy, Evolution Mental Health Workshops offer tools for nervous system regulation, and psychological safety. This emphasis reflects a growing need: anxiety and depression symptoms are estimated to cost Singapore nearly $16 billion annually, or 2.9 per cent of its GDP, due to lost productivity. By offering tools for healing and self-awareness, Glow invites participants to reclaim their calm, clarity, and connection, from the inside out. Health Conversations, presented by Prudential Singapore and Thomson Medical, invites participants into open, specialist-led dialogues across a wide spectrum of health and wellbeing topics. From protecting your vision in a digital-first world to tips on how to raise confident kids, to the role of Traditional Chinese Medicine in healing and sports injury prevention, these sessions reflect the growing need for whole-person health support. Women's health remains a key focus, with honest conversations around fertility, hormonal balance, and intimacy helping to bring overlooked aspects of wellbeing into the light. New Conversations on Modern Womanhood: Malaysian entrepreneur and creative Jane Lau (known widely as Jane Chuck), joins forces with Germaine Chow, CEO and co-founder of I Quadrant, to explore identity, ambition, and caregiving in a conversation that invites vulnerability, self-reinvention, and solidarity. Movement That Moves You Glow Festival by Prudential 2025 brings together global wellness leaders and local changemakers to stretch what's possible in the wellness space. Among this year's headliners: Dylan Werner , international yoga master, shares a grounded, science-meets-spirit approach to breathwork and movement. Olivia May , elite sprinter and trainer, offers athlete-inspired workouts that tap into inner focus and physical precision. Dannibelle Robertson , strength coach and digital personality, leads empowering sessions that celebrate self-acceptance and joyful fitness. Sunrise Rave Runs blend cardio with curated music and morning energy, redefining social connection through alcohol-free, movement-forward events. With resident DJ collective Beans&Beats and a rotating lineup of local DJs setting the tone, these high-vibe mornings offer a uniquely Singaporean soundscape to start the day. All runners will receive a cup of specialty coffee and a signature Croclair, a croissant-e\u0301clair hybrid, crafted by LUME. By providing wellness-focused, community-driven events in the morning, Glow Festival by Prudential 2025 is leading the way in creating innovative daytime social experiences that blend movement, music, and connection. It demonstrates that wellness tourism and vibrant social culture can thrive well beyond the traditional nightlife model. SG60: Singapore's First 60KM Ultra Marathon, presented with Noble, commemorates Singapore's 60th birthday with a 60-kilometre overnight run to spotlight mental health. While Singapore saw a 32.4 per cent drop in suicides in 2023, the lowest since 2000, suicide remains the leading cause of death for those aged 10 to 29, accounting for about 30 per cent of all deaths in this age group. This stark reality underscores the urgent need for open conversations and community support. Part of the proceeds will go to the Samaritans of Singapore, supporting suicide prevention and mental health awareness. Noble Ambassador Jordan Hamada leads the charge in memory of his father, who died by suicide. Feel It in the Space This year's spatial design, created by Pique Studio, brings the Wellness Frequency to life: an immersive journey across energy states: The Studio The Workshop Room The Studio is a livewire of radiant orange, luminous pink, and echo purple - a space designed to ignite physical vitality. Here, yoga flows, strength classes, and high-energy movement sessions unfold against a bold, high-voltage backdrop that stokes the body's inner fire. Moving into The Wellness Club, the mood shifts. Vibrancy gives way to vital greens and tranquil blues, signalling a return to earth. Natural textures, living plants, and organic landscapes create a soft sanctuary for recovery, reflection, and meaningful connection. In The Workshop Room, the frequency deepens. Colours soften, textures calm, and the space invites stillness. Talks, hands-on workshops, and guided meditations find their rhythm here - a place built for inward exploration and personal evolution. Join the Movement Glow Festival by Prudential 2025 aims to ignite a broader conversation: that wellness is a cultural invitation to reset, recharge, and reconnect with your body, your people, and your purpose. Tickets are now on sale via the official website here. Early bird General Admission (SGD 29) includes access to one Main Studio class and a bundle of limited edition Glow Festival x Prudential Singapore merchandise, along with health and fitness treats from LAC, Liht Organics, and more. VIP tickets with additional perks will be announced closer to the festival. -END- About Glow Festival by Prudential Glow Festival by Prudential is Singapore's definitive health and wellness lifestyle festival, designed to inspire healthier, happier living through movement, mindfulness, and connection.
