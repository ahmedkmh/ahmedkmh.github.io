China's Nanning City", "description": "BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Recording of the 2026 Global Youth Spring Festival Gala (Nanning main venue) was completed on January 16 in Nanning, capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Featuring the \"Horse\" zodiac as a cultural symbol, the gala brought together young artists from China, ASEAN countries, the United Kingdom, Nigeria, and Brazil to showcase a blend of technological innovation and cultural exchange. Guided by the State Council Information Office, the gala focused on \"youth co-creation\" and \"tech empowerment\". Utilizing cloud choruses, real-time links, and cross-border field trips, the gala broke the limits of a single stage to create a multi-dimensional space for international dialogue. Technological integration served as a major highlight. The opening performance, \"AI on Spring,\" featured singers from China and ASEAN countries performing a song composed with the help of artificial intelligence. The act combined traditional lion dances with \"AI mechanical dogs\" and used AR technology to display digital spring couplets. Additionally, the gala introduced \"Fubao,\" an AI digital human inspired by Zhuang brocade patterns, to guide transitions and interpret cultural meanings. In terms of cultural collaboration, international artists performed several innovative acts. Youth musicians joined for the instrumental piece \"Sea and Mountain Harmony,\" while singers from China, Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam performed a multi-language cloud chorus of the classic \"Jasmine Flower\". A \"Tai Chi\" performance featured martial arts enthusiasts from China and Brazil set against an AI-generated landscape. The gala also presented intangible cultural heritage through modern lenses, including a hip-hop version of the \"Yingge\" dance and an acrobatic piece blending ancient rock art with Dunhuang motifs. During the recording period, international youth participants joined the \"YOUNG-LINK \u2022 Meeting in Nanning\" activity. They visited industrial parks, historical districts, and night markets to experience the urban development and culture of the host city. The gala has been held for 19 consecutive sessions, with programs broadcast in more than 100 countries and regions.

While technology giants pour billions into AI capacity, history cautions against exuberance, underscoring the need to focus on high\u2010quality large\u2010cap tech and AI supply chain leaders. At the same time, Asia's expanding role in AI and ongoing market reforms are creating a supportive backdrop for earnings and valuations. Against this dynamic landscape, CIMB highlights opportunities in resilient Asian equities, quality corporate bonds, and diversified portfolios enhanced with hedging strategies to navigate volatility and deliver sustainable returns. \"Policy support and interest rate cuts have given capital markets a strong start, but as we move into 2026, we remain cautious of fiscal challenges, shifting global trends, and concentrated bets in AI,\" said Jason Kuan, Director, Investment Research and Advisory at Chief Investment Office, CIMB Singapore. \"At CIMB, we recommend focusing on the 3Ds: Discipline by staying selective with quality stocks and credit; Diversification by adding exposure to Asia, with defensive markets like Singapore and Malaysia; and Derisking through gold, hedge strategies, private equity, and tailored structured investments. This balanced approach helps investors seize opportunities while staying resilient through market volatility.\" Kuan added, \"Investors may want to be more selective than just focusing on the U.S. market. U.S. stock prices are currently quite high, and uncertainty around trade policies and government spending could create more volatility. Because of this, we expect more investors to look beyond U.S. markets and explore opportunities in Asia. Singapore, in particular, stands out as a safe and stable investment destination, supported by reforms that have boosted confidence and driven strong returns. At the same time, gold has surged to new highs as investors seek safety amid global tensions. While corrections may present opportunities to add positions, we believe gold should be part of a diversified portfolio, but caution against chasing the rally simply on recent gains.\" AI Will Shape the Market Narrative in 2026 Leading technology companies are investing billions to meet the surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) compute capacity. While AI continues to stand out as a powerful long-term investment theme, current market dynamics call for measured caution. History shows that periods of exuberance often precede the adoption of truly transformative technologies. In this environment, CIMB recommends focusing on high-quality large-cap technology companies and AI supply chain leaders, which are better positioned to withstand volatility and deliver sustainable growth. AI Momentum and Market Reforms Position Asia as Key Investment Destination Two key forces are shaping the next phase of Asian equities: the region's expanding role in the global AI supply chain and market reforms across major economies that are enhancing governance, liquidity, and creating a more supportive backdrop for earnings and valuations. Beyond the US, Asia is playing an increasingly important role in the global AI supply chain. The rise of DeepSeek in China, coupled with sustained demand for semiconductors and AI\u2010related hardware in Taiwan region, South Korea, and Japan, underscores the region's growing technological capabilities. At the same time, structural reforms are strengthening capital markets. Japan and South Korea are driving improved capital allocation and shareholder returns, China is channeling more institutional capital into domestic equities while supporting buybacks and tightening oversight of listed companies, and Singapore is implementing measures to revitalise the equity market, attract investment, and boost liquidity in small- and midcap stocks. For investors, these developments suggest Asia will remain a significant investment destination, offering opportunities in markets with clear earnings visibility, reform momentum, and policy support - while acknowledging that geopolitical risks and global economic conditions will continue to shape volatility. Navigating Volatility in a Weaker U.S. Dollar Global growth is expected to proceed at a more measured pace, with stronger momentum in the first half of the year, followed by moderation in the second half as the delayed impact of tariffs takes effect. In the U.S., Federal Reserve rate cuts and sustained investment spending, particularly in AI and infrastructure, should continue to support growth, even as fiscal sustainability remains a longer\u2010term concern. The U.S. dollar is likely to stay on a weakening trajectory in 2026, though the decline is expected to be volatile rather than linear. For investors, this underscores the importance of diversifying away from the U.S. dollar, especially during periods of temporary strength, while remaining mindful that volatility may intensify around key events such as changes in Fed leadership and the U.S. mid\u2010term elections. Enhancing Portfolio Stability Through Fixed Income Fixed income is set to play a more important stabilising role in portfolios in 2026, as bond market volatility is expected to rise amid global uncertainty. Additionally, the U.S. yield curves are expected to bear-steepen, creating a more complex environment for bond investors. In 2026, we recommend building a bond portfolio with an average short\u2010to\u2010mid duration, focusing on high\u2010quality corporate bonds in the three- to seven-year range. These bonds can provide steady income, supported by strong companies with solid financials. Within this space, AUD\u2010 and GBP\u2010denominated bonds are especially appealing, with the former offering attractive returns and the latter providing potential gains, while helping to keep risk under control. Building Portfolio Resilience As global markets shift, staying diversified is more important than ever, investors can benefit from balancing portfolios across core global equities and fixed income. We see promising opportunities in Asian equities and short-to-mid tenor corporate bonds, which offer attractive value. Adding hedges through gold and selective structured investments can further strengthen resilience, helping portfolios deliver steadier, risk-adjusted returns in uncertain times.

"Tencent Cloud at Davos: Unlocking AI for all, Bringing Value within Reach", "description": "DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 22, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- At the Annual Meeting of World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Dowson Tong, Senior Executive Vice-President of Tencent and CEO of Tencent Cloud and Smart Industries Group, emphasized that the real-world value of artificial intelligence is further unlocked when open ecosystems empower consumers and enterprises to choose from a diversity of large models tailored to specific, real-life applications. Dowson Tong, Senior Executive Vice-President of Tencent and CEO of Tencent Cloud and Smart Industries Group speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos \"When people talk about AI, we tend to think of one big super system and give it a term AGI. But in fact, there are many different types of models that serve different purposes,\" said Tong. \"For Tencent Cloud, we understand that customers want choices. That's also our AI strategy, to provide tools, products that are model agnostic. I think that gives the power of choosing the right model for themselves back to the hands of the customers.\" He added. This is the cornerstone of Tencent's AI strategy, which is rooted in a two-pronged approach. The company is simultaneously advancing its own proprietary model capabilities, while remaining open and collaborative to global large model innovations. The goal is to ensure that every user and enterprise can choose the most effective model for their unique needs, empowering them to solve real-world challenges effectively. Internal Transformation as a Blueprint for Large Model Innovation Tencent's own operations serve as a proving ground for its AI vision. The company's internal AI coding assistant, CodeBuddy, is now used by more than 12,000 engineers and helps generate over half of all new code. The tool has cut average coding time by more than 40%, and in a telling example of its capability, 90% of the code for Tencent's recently upgraded AI CLI tool CodeBuddy Code was generated by the assistant itself. In addition, Tencent is committed to investing in its full-stack Hunyuan large model series. Over the past year, the company has released more than 30 new models, spanning multiple domains including enhanced hybrid reasoning, image generation, video synthesis, and 3D content creation. The high-performance Hunyuan 2.0, which uses a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with 406 billion total parameters (with 32 billion activated parameters), placing it at the forefront of the industry in terms of both inference capability and operational efficiency. Meanwhile, Tencent's open-source Hunyuan 3D model has been downloaded more than 3 million times on open-source platform Hugging Face, becoming one of the most popular 3D open-source model for creators, developers and open-source communities worldwide. To date, Hunyuan is already powering over 900 internal Tencent business scenarios\u2014from Tencent Meeting and Weixin/WeChat to gaming and advertising. The impact is tangible: the 2025 third quarter finance report indicates a strong AI-driven growth. AI contributed to a 21% year-on-year increase in marketing service revenue and a 22.8% rise in gaming revenue for Tencent. Real-World AI: From Industry Transformation to Empowering Future Generations Tencent brings this expertise to customers through a simple but powerful framework: agent-based tools, cloud-native platform support, and plug-and-play solutions. This approach has already delivered results across more than 30 sectors. Retailers use Tencent's AI to accelerate 3D product design; medical researchers apply it to new medicine discovery; and marketers rely on it to increase marketing conversion. One notable example is global 3D printing leader Bambu Lab, which used the Hunyuan 3D model to reengineer its design workflow\u2014making professional-grade modeling accessible to a broader audience and fueling a new wave of consumer creativity. Tong also highlighted the importance of making AI tools available to the young learners. The new generation can not only learn how to use AI via educational institutions, but also via AI applications like Tencent Yuanbao. He said, \"Encouraging the new generation to be curious and use these freely accessible AI tools would be the best way to develop the habits of using AI as part of the learning tools.\" About Tencent Cloud Tencent Cloud, one of the world's leading cloud companies, is committed to creating innovative solutions to resolve real-world issues and enabling digital transformation for smart industries.
