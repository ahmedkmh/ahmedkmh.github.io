As I grow older, memories of the past gradually resurface in my mind, but they come back in fragments. Certain scenes that once moved me continue to stir something within me. The distance of a thousand miles has made me reflect more deeply on the meaning of home and family in my life. My photographic series Traces of Light uses memory as its vessel. I revisit places that once held those memories, seeking traces of time, layering remembered fragments over present-day scenes. In my recollections, those magical objects often glow, like little time machines guiding us against the current of time's flow, carrying us back to the hometowns of our memory. Light Hopscotch Chen Yumeng \u2013 Where the Light Ends (Second Prize) My visual notebook stitches together the folds of life through fractured perspectives, bringing back everyday fragments, weathered by time, into focus. Within these small, wayward stages, the disorder of objects and the poetics of living merge in a dance of entanglement. As existence itself becomes the developing fluid, each fleeting moment expands in the darkroom, branching into nebula-like roots of narrative. Salt Patterns of the Earth (2) Huang Anni \u2013 Butterfly Prison (Third Prize) [Tie] I am a person with delicate emotions and strong empathy, yet also lively and cheerful by nature. Growing up immersed in Lingnan culture, however, my life has been shaped by the constant pull between tradition and modernity. In Guangdong's clan-based culture\u2014like the sprawling roots of a towering tree\u2014tradition permeates daily life: women's names are rarely recorded in ancestral tablets, my mother busied herself in the kitchen during festivals while men performed the rituals, and conversations about granddaughters inevitably circled back to marriage. Though my own family is relatively egalitarian, I still feel the weight of these unspoken rules during each holiday gathering. Many of my female friends continue to be shaped by such norms, often lacking self-confidence, or developing a people-pleasing disposition. Through my photography, I hope to inspire and encourage them to break free from these constraints, to build confidence, and to live beyond the limits imposed by tradition. The creative process itself has also been a journey of self-growth. In shaping female figures within my work, I sought to convey a core idea: womanhood is not simply a gender, but a condition. It is a refusal to live under the gaze of gender, to reject objectification, and to resist the shame and expectations imposed on women's bodies today. In the age of social media, the female body has become a consumable image\u2014what should be healthy and natural is instead distorted into a \"perfect figure.\" The butterfly, a creature often symbolizing rebirth and freedom, became a central motif throughout my series. Beyond being a striking visual element, it serves as a symbol carrying my deep yearning for liberation and renewal. Specimen Li Yuxiang \u2013 Yu Hui (Third Prize) Yu Hui is a photo series I created in 2024, documenting my nephew. Living with him day in and day out gave me the chance to observe him closely and truly get to know him. He is a mischievous and energetic seven-year-old boy, well cared for and protected by his parents. Each day after waking, his greatest priority is to play\u2014free of worries, free of concerns. He finds endless fascination in things I might otherwise dismiss as meaningless: a piece of cardboard, or a pile of pesticide bottles, can keep him happily engaged for hours. From the outside, I watched him through my lens, capturing the precious qualities of childhood that shine so clearly in him. In his world there are no narrow confines, no constraints, only openness and freedom.
