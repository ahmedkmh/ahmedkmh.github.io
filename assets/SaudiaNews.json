This technology enables up to a 65% reduction in sugar content while preserving essential nutrients, making high-sugar fruits such as durian, mango, and banana healthier for consumption. Chula\u2019s Breakthrough Arto Sucrose-reduces Tech Cuts Sugar in Fruits by 65% and Converts to Prebiotics for Healthier Eating Dr. Supaart was inspired by the dual challenge of managing Thailand's oversupply of high-sugar fruits and addressing public health concerns related to excessive sugar intake, which is linked to chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Through a proprietary formulation of commercially available enzymes, the Arto process converts sucrose into prebiotic compounds\u2014non-digestible carbohydrates that support gut microbiota health. The technology is versatile, functioning effectively with both fresh and dried fruits, and is suitable for incorporation into a variety of food products. In collaboration with local farming communities, surplus produce is transformed into value-added items such as sugar-reduced dried bananas, mango smoothies, flourless banana cakes, and choco banana sherbet. Although Arto offers finished products, its primary focus is on the production and sale of sugar-reduced fruit pure\u0301e for use in industrial food applications. The project is supported by Chula Spin-Off and the CU Innovation Hub, which have provided essential resources, including business development training, funding opportunities, and commercialization guidance. Arto aligns with global health-conscious food trends, especially in regions like Europe, where demand for high-sugar fruit juices is declining due to increasing awareness of sugar-related health risks. Looking ahead, Dr. Supaart and his research team are expanding their work to explore enzyme-assisted conversions of starches into functional nutrients, further contributing to the development of health-promoting food technologies. However, scaling up production and integrating the technology into industrial food systems remain key challenges to widespread adoption. Dr. Supaart emphasizes the critical need to bridge scientific research with real-world applications, fostering collaboration with entrepreneurs and communities to ensure the successful commercialization of Arto technology. For consumers seeking guilt-free desserts and healthier fruit-based alternatives, Arto's sugar-reduced innovations offer a promising solution.

Portal\", Enabling Seamless and Secure Transactions for the Tourism Industry", "link": "https://en.prnasia.com/story/486174-0.shtml", "keywords": ["fnt", "hrt", "cpr", "pdt", "mlm", "fin", "tra"], "creator": null, "description": "SIEM REAP, Cambodia, April 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Cathay United Bank (CUB) has been providing innovative and convenient financial services in Cambodia since 2023 through its expertise in digital finance. In response to the growing demand in Cambodia's tourism industry, Cathay United Bank Cambodia (CUBC) has partnered with Mastercard to launch the \"CUBC Payment Link Portal (CPL)\", a secure and user-friendly payment platform that enables hospitality providers to accept online payments via Mastercard and Visa, without the need to set up their own website or mobile app. By simply logging into the service's portal, a payment link can be quickly generated, with a focus on collaborating with accommodation providers. According to Cambodia's Ministry of Tourism, the country welcomed 6.7 million international visitors in 2024, surpassing pre-pandemic levels and demonstrating a strong recovery in the tourism industry. TripAdvisor, the world's largest travel platform, also ranked Siem Reap and Phnom Penh among the \"Top 25 Travel Destinations in Asia.\" Cambodia's coastal and provincial regions have gained popularity among international visitors for their eco-tourism opportunities, allowing travelers to explore the country's natural beauty and rich cultural heritage. CUBC has observed this trend. Mr.Kevin Yeh, President of CUBC, notes that more travelers now prefer to book customized itineraries\u2014such as local market tours, cooking classes, or cycling trips\u2014before arriving at the destination. Meanwhile, hospitality providers generally prefer to receive payments in advance to secure reservations. However, major booking platforms do not always meet these requirements. To bridge this gap, CUBC has introduced the CPL, allowing hospitality providers to offer tailored travel packages and accept international payments online. They can also offer exclusive direct booking benefits, such as room upgrades or complimentary spa treatments, helping them stay competitive in Cambodia's tourism industry. Moreover, the CPL offers additional features tailored to hospitality providers. Users can create and manage product lists, eliminating the need to manually enter service details for each transaction. The platform also features automated notifications, sending booking details and payment confirmations to both businesses and customers via e-mail or messaging apps. Additionally, the CPL dashboard allows businesses to track bookings and payment status across desktops, tablets, or mobile devices, ensuring efficient order and revenue management. CUBC has been at the forefront of digital transformation, continuously improving its services to support businesses and customers. In 2023, it launched the CUBC new mBanking app, allowing users to transfer funds and make KHQR payments. Now, with the CPL in 2025, businesses can generate secure payment links without the need to set up their own website or checkout page. These links can be sent directly to customers via messaging apps, email, or SMS, ensuring seamless transactions. Payments made through the CPL are safeguarded by EMV 3DS 2.0 authentication, offering fraud protection and enhanced security. CUBC warmly invites hospitality businesses to apply for the CPL and take advantage of Cambodia's growing tourism market. The service offers easy operation for businesses and secure transactions for travelers. Businesses that sign up before the end of the year can enjoy an exclusive promotional offer. For more details, please visit any CUBC branch or www.cathaybk.com.kh/business/merchant-services. CUBC Payment Link facilitates merchants to accept 3D online Mastercard & Visa card payment without website or mobile app, just 3 steps to complete the transaction. CUBC Payment Link Portal is featured with setting product list in advance, checking order status, and financial reconciliation which is ideally for back office operations.
