A representative from China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd. (CSG) was invited to address the \"Global South Talks\" session during the opening ceremony, sharing the company's on-the-ground experience in power-grid cooperation with countries across the Global South. Sun Shengjun, Project General Manager of the Africa and Europe Regional Development Department at China Southern Power Grid International, described CSG's experience and efforts to deepen China\u2013Africa energy ties in Cairo, Egypt. In 2023, Sun and his team arrived in Cairo to address chronic problems in the local power grid, including high line losses and poor operating performance. They progressively introduced CSG's operational measures for cutting distribution network losses and rolled out practical, scalable and replicable \"CSG Solutions\" for the local utility. In addition to its technical efforts, CSG has focused on developing a skilled local workforce through targeted training programs and technical knowledge-sharing sessions. By matching its technology to on-the-ground operating realities and investing in workforce training, the company has sought to align its mature technical systems with local needs while fostering homegrown technical capabilities, laying the groundwork for long-term engagement. Sun said that CSG does not regard energy cooperation as a one-way street, but as a partnership rooted in mutual benefit and shared growth. Looking ahead, the company says it will continue to provide its technologies and management expertise to Global South countries, aimed at deepening China\u2013Africa energy cooperation and supporting plans for broader collaboration across the Global South.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["uti", "oil", "tds", "eut", "brd", "cpr"], "creator": null, "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["business", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-21 03:20:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 4111305, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/en_prnasisa.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": true}, {"article_id": "ad8a9bfe19842954bb06789e3989e713", "link": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/foxconn-can-make-1000-ai-racks-week-increase-next-year-chairman-says-5481781", "title": "Foxconn can make 1,000 AI racks a week, to increase next year, chairman says", "description": "TAIPEI :Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said on Friday the company now had the capability to manufacture 1,000 artificial intelligence racks per week, and it expected that rate to increase next year.Liu made the comments at the contract electronics manufacturer's tech day, which was attended by Foxconn's partners", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["business"], "creator": ["CNA"], "language": "english", "country": ["georgia", "yemen", "afghanistan", "cyprus", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "maldives", "japan", "united arab emirates", "malaysia", "china", "south korea", "north korea", "taiwan", "thailand", "pakistan", "mongolia", "brunei", "lebanon", "indonesia", "kyrgyzstan", "syria", "israel", "bhutan", "iran", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "kazakhstan", "iraq", "bangladesh", "laos", "vietnam", "timor-leste", "kuwait", "myanmar", "azerbaijan", "jordan", "nepal", "sri lanka", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "cambodia", "tajikistan", "oman"], "category": ["top", "technology"], "pubDate": "2025-11-21 03:18:05", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--eMwYpXuZ--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_468,w_830/v1/one-cms/core/2025-11-21T031831Z_2_LYNXMPELAK042_RTROPTP_3_FOXCONN-TAIWAN-AI.JPG?itok=R9gKpHvN", "video_url": null, "source_id": "channelnewsasia", "source_name": "Channel Newsasia", "source_priority": 4763, "source_url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/channelnewsasia.jpg", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": true}, {"article_id": "00b9ddc9e81f631f3164c5a9fdc5fbb9", "link": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/foxconn-nvidia-14-billion-taiwan-supercomputing-cluster-be-ready-h1-2026-foxconn-says-5481781", "title": "Foxconn-Nvidia $1.4 billion Taiwan supercomputing cluster to be ready by H1 2026, Foxconn says", "description": "TAIPEI :Foxconn said on Friday that a $1.4 billion supercomputing centre it is building with Nvidia will be ready by the first half of 2026, and when complete will be Taiwan's largest advanced GPU cluster.

YORK, Nov. 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Observed annually on the third Thursday of November each year, Worldwide Pressure Injury Prevention Day serves as a global reminder of the urgent need to prevent pressure injuries, also known as pressure ulcers or bedsores, among vulnerable populations. Established by the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel (NPIAP) and supported by organizations worldwide, the day aims to raise public awareness, promote evidence-based prevention strategies, and highlight the importance of early intervention for individuals at risk, including those who are bedridden, wheelchair users, and older adults. As the world marks this year's observance, Dimora Medical, a continuous innovator in high-end medical care supplies, reaffirms its long-standing commitment to pressure injury patients and the caregivers who support them, emphasizing its role as a dedicated partner in advanced chronic care. Dimora silicone foam dressings for pressure ulcers, bedsores. The significance of this global awareness day continues to grow as healthcare systems confront the rising prevalence of pressure injuries. Evidence from U.S. federal healthcare data indicates that hospital-acquired pressure injuries occur at a rate of approximately 4.5%. These injuries are associated with longer hospital stays, elevated risk of complications, and increased mortality, underscoring a major clinical and economic burden. Research examining preventive strategies has further highlighted the importance of proactive skin protection. Research comparing silicone foam dressings with traditional prevention protocols suggests that silicone foam may offer superior results when used as a prophylactic measure, providing a promising avenue for both prevention and early-stage intervention. Against this backdrop, Dimora's silicone foam dressing offers an effective solution for individuals at risk of pressure-related skin damage. Designed for both healing support and comfort, the dressing uses a five-layer construction that absorbs up to fifteen times its weight in exudate, maintains optimal moisture balance, and provides a protective external barrier. Its medical-grade hypoallergenic silicone contact layer adheres gently to dry skin without sticking to moist wound beds, helping reduce pain and minimize trauma during dressing changes. The semi-permeable polyurethane film is waterproof and breathable, allowing oxygen and vapor exchange while blocking fluids and lowering cross-infection risk. A thick foam core, fluid-locking layer, and nonwoven distribution layer work together to prevent maceration, extend wear time, and streamline daily care. Suitable for a broad range of moderately to heavily exuding wounds, including pressure ulcers, surgical sites, leg ulcers, and burns, the dressing is widely used across hospitals, senior care facilities, hospices, and home care environments. As Worldwide Pressure Injury Prevention Day highlights the importance of prevention, education, and patient-centered care, Dimora reaffirms its dedication to protecting skin integrity and supporting those at risk. This commitment extends beyond product performance, reflecting a broader focus on dignity, comfort, and quality of life. Through clinically informed design and reliable support, the brand strives to remain a trusted partner to patients and caregivers, advancing compassionate and effective care in line with the spirit of this global observance.

While the global recognition of World Heritage is breathing new vitality into Quanzhou's inbound tourism market, the city, rich in World Heritage resources, has been taking efforts to continuously optimize its inbound tourism services in recent years.

Tourism revenue from international visitors reached 2.995 billion yuan (about 421 million U.S. dollars), up 83.3 percent from the same period last year. Behind these figures lies the significant role of distinctive tourist routes Quanzhou developed by leveraging its World Heritage IPs. From the thousand-year-old Kaiyuan Temple to the exotic architecture of Qingjing Mosque, each heritage site functions as a \"cultural magnet\" for international visitors. Meanwhile, the city's \"Maritime Silk Road Quanzhou\" International Tourism Promoter Program has ensured its listing among the top 100 Asian tourism destinations released by China's online tourism service provider Ctrip.com, further raising Quanzhou's reputation and influence in the global tourism market.

In the future, the city plans to deepen cooperation with UNESCO. It will promote its heritage conservation experience globally through the UN platforms while introducing advanced international concepts and approaches for cultural tourism development into Quanzhou, aiming to promote higher-quality development of the cultural tourism industry. Additionally, Quanzhou will leverage its World Heritage IP to develop cross-border cultural trade initiatives, enabling its intangible cultural heritage products and cultural creative goods to enter the global market. During the visit to Quanzhou, Assomo described the city as a \"living heritage\" and spoke highly of the city's approach to cultural heritage conservation. He also expressed his expectation \"to promote China's heritage conservation experience\".
