WealthAhead II Series strengthens wealth management, wealth allocation, as well as wealth succession, supporting customers to grow their wealth efficiently with enhanced liquidity. WealthAhead II Series introduces the market-first1 Wealth Master Service[2], enabling customers to pre-set periodic withdrawal instructions to build cash flows for up to three designated recipients. Additionally, the Series incorporates trust-like[3] features such as the Heritage Protector Option, which allows customers to pre-set succession events \u2014 including death or incapacitation \u2014 specify the designated age for inheritance, and appoint contingent owner and interim owner[5], ensuring secure and smooth wealth across generations. Janet Lee, Chief Life and Health Insurance Officer of AXA Hong Kong and Macau, said: \"With the US Federal Reserve initiating its first rate cut of the year and signalling the beginning of a broader easing cycle, markets are anticipating two further reductions within the year. Against this evolving macroeconomic backdrop, investors are increasingly prioritising long-term, stable asset allocation strategies that offer growth potential. Noting that today's wealth management needs extend beyond simple savings or high returns. Customers are seeking holistic solutions that encompass asset accumulation, liquidity management, legacy planning and strategic wealth distribution across different life stages. In response, we have introduced WealthAhead II Series, which retains the strong total return potential of its predecessor while incorporating the market-first[1] Wealth Master Service[2] and trust-like[3] wealth succession tool. These enhancements empower customers to manage their wealth with greater flexibility, enabling them to plan effectively for wealth transition and succession, achieving their financial goals while meeting wealth distribution needs throughout every stage of life.\" Three Key Highlights of the WealthAhead II Series Include: Multi-currency options to capture global opportunities with flexible convertibility and gain lock-in featuresWealthAhead II Series offers premium payment terms of 5 and 10 years, with a choice of up to 9 currencies[6]. It also includes flexible currency conversion option[7]. From the third policy anniversary onwards, customers may convert their policy to another currency without affecting the total cash value or incurring any handling fees \u2014 enabling agile asset reallocation in response to market movements. The Series also features a Policy Value Lock-in Option[8], allowing customers to secure gains at opportune moments and mitigate future volatility. Additionally, the market-first dual-currency account[9] acts as a flexible cash reserve, with interest payable on the selected currency. Flexible Wealth Management \u2013 Personalised Wealth Allocation in ActionWealthAhead II Series introduces the market-first[1] Wealth Master Service[2], enabling customers to pre-set periodic withdrawal instructions tailored for up to three designated recipients. Payments are made automatically at scheduled intervals, creating personalised income streams that support precise and strategic wealth distribution. The Series also features a Flexi Segregation Option. From the first policy anniversary onwards, customers can transfer part of the value from existing policy to a separate policy and subsequently exercise different policy options for each \u2014 ensuring the solution aligns with the distinct financial goals of individual family members. Steady Wealth Accumulation Across Generations \u2013 Ensuring Seamless Wealth TransferThe Series offers a suite of features designed to help customers safeguard their legacy and support intergenerational wealth planning. At the policy level, customers may arrange for policy continuation and succession by designating a contingent owner, interim owner, contingent insured, or by exercising the change of insured option. Additionally, customers may also appoint a designated executor and select from a range of death benefit settlement options to facilitate direct and efficient wealth distribution to family members. Heritage Protector Option[10] \u2013 From policy commencement, customers can proactively plan for succession by appointing a contingent owner and, if necessary, an interim owner. They may specify the succession event \u2014 such as death or incapacitation \u2014 and set a designated age for succession. If the contingent owner has not reached the specified age at the time of the succession event, the interim owner will assume ownership and manage the policy in accordance with the granted right predefined by the client, ensuring that wealth is transferred securely and in line with the client's intentions. Flexi Continuation Option \u2013 From policy commencement, customers may designate a contingent insured[11] to allow part of the policy to continue following the passing of the current insured, while also providing a compassionate benefit. This feature enables a flexible balance between life protection and wealth transfer. Change of Insured Option[12]\u2013 Starting from the first policy anniversary, customers may change the insured an unlimited number of times, allowing substantial wealth to be passed down through generations. Flexi Care Option[13] \u2013 From policy commencement, customers may appoint a designated executor. In the event of the policy owner's mental or physical incapacitation, the designated executor may apply for a one-time withdrawal of a certain percentage of the total cash value, without the need for complex legal procedures. Tailored Death Benefit Settlement Options \u2013 Customers may select different settlement methods for each beneficiary, including lump sum payment, payment by instalments, or hybrid payments, to meet their legacy planning goals. Irrespective of the chosen option, customers may defer the first payment of death benefit for up to 30 years[14], allowing beneficiaries to receive the proceeds at the most appropriate time.
