HANGZHOU, China, Oct. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The 2025 Silk Road Week, a global cultural initiative celebrating the spirit of exchange and cooperation along the ancient Silk Road, successfully concluded in Brazil, marking the event's first-ever finale in South America. The closing activities took place in the twin cities of Sa\u0303o Paulo and Foz do Iguac\u0327u, featuring a series of exhibitions, demonstrations, and academic dialogues that highlighted the enduring vitality of silk culture and the deepening partnership between China and Brazil. Chinese costume fashion show during the exhibition A Landmark Celebration in Sa\u0303o Paulo The Sa\u0303o Paulo segment of the closing program centered around three major events \u2014 the exhibition \"Silk Connects Mountains and Seas: From China to Brazil\", the demonstration \"Beyond the Mulberry Fields: China Sericulture Intangible Cultural Heritages,\" and the symposium \"Sino-Brazilian Academic Dialogue: Museums Promoting Sustainable Development of Cultural Heritage.\" The opening ceremony and exhibition inauguration were held at the Museum of Immigration of the State of Sa\u0303o Paulo, bringing together distinguished guests from both countries, including representatives from the Publicity Department of the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Culture, Radio, Television and Tourism, the China National Silk Museum, the Consulate-General of the People's Republic of China in Sa\u0303o Paulo, and local museum and cultural institutions. Prior to the official opening, around 50 primary school students from Sa\u0303o Paulo participated in hands-on workshops led by the China National Silk Museum. The activities \u2014 gilded fan printing and traditional loom weaving \u2014 introduced children to the artistry of Chinese sericulture and the timeless beauty of silk craftsmanship. The event provided a vivid and playful bridge between young audiences and traditional culture. \"Silk Road Week\": A Global Platform for Cultural Exchange Initiated by National Cultural Heritage Administration of China and Zhejiang Provincial Government, Silk Road Week has been held annually for five consecutive years. It serves as a global platform to promote cultural dialogue, museum cooperation, and shared values of mutual understanding along the Silk Road. In 2025, Brazil was selected as the Guest Country of Honor, marking a milestone in China\u2013Latin America cultural collaboration. The Brazil events were designed as the concluding chapter of the year's global Silk Road Week program, with a particular focus on exhibitions and creative engagements that illustrate the living legacy of silk. \"Silk Connects Mountains and Seas\": A Bridge Between Civilizations Jointly curated by the China National Silk Museum and the Museum of Immigration of Sa\u0303o Paulo, \"Silk Connects Mountains and Seas: From China to Brazil\" is one of the first projects under China's \"Bridges of Civilization\" Initiative launched by the National Cultural Heritage Administration of China. The exhibition traces silk's journey from ancient China to the Americas, showcasing its dual role as a cultural symbol and a medium of exchange. Through authentic artifacts, immersive design, and interactive programming, it demonstrates how silk has woven connections among peoples, ideas, and artistic traditions across time and space. The display also features contributions from Huzhou, a city renowned for its silk heritage. The exhibition will remain open to the public at the Museum of Immigration till March, 2026, offering visitors an opportunity to explore the shared heritage of silk through engaging displays and multimedia experiences. Extending the Celebration to Foz do Iguac\u0327u Following the events in Sa\u0303o Paulo, the celebration continued in Foz do Iguac\u0327u, located in Brazil's southern Parana\u0301 State \u2014 a global hub of hydroelectric innovation and a member of the Silk Road Cities Alliance.

The city's participation reflects the broader partnership between Zhejiang Province and Parana\u0301 State, which have maintained a sister-province relationship fostering cultural and economic cooperation. During the event, the China National Silk Museum and the Municipal Government of Foz do Iguac\u0327u signed a three-year cooperation agreement to develop a \"Overseas Gallery of CNSM\" in the city, marking a new chapter of long-term collaboration. Leveraging Foz do Iguac\u0327u's global reputation as a tourism and cultural destination, both sides will co-host future initiatives integrating heritage, fashion, and innovation \u2014 beginning with the Silk Road Heritage Innovative Design Fashion Show, which reimagines traditional silk in the language of contemporary design. A Shared Vision for the Future The successful conclusion of the 2025 Silk Road Week in Brazil not only celebrated the shared legacy of the Silk Road but also reaffirmed a forward-looking vision of cultural sustainability. Through exhibitions, academic exchange, and community engagement, the events reflected how museums and cultural institutions can act as catalysts for dialogue and cooperation between nations. As the Silk Road Week continues to evolve, its mission remains constant \u2014 to connect civilizations through mutual learning and creative exchange.
