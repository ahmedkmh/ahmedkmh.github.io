Any incident in a residential setting can lead to serious consequences, and recent reports of accidents have further heightened public concern. In response, Sungrow has taken proactive steps to strengthen industry confidence and advance safety standards. After successfully completing two real-unit combustion verifications in utility-scale storage, Sungrow has now extended its rigorous approach to the residential sector. The SBH Series: Residential ESS has achieved a significant milestone by passing the world's first UL 9540B large-scale fire test, conducted by UL Solutions. This achievement highlights Sungrow's industry-leading expertise in thermal runaway management and fire spread control, setting a new global standard for residential ESS safety. UL 9540B Testing UL 9540B, specifically designed for residential energy storage systems range from 20kWh and below, is widely regarded as the industry's most stringent safety standard. The test subject systems are subjected to forced thermal runaway while fully charged, simulating extreme fire scenarios, including flammable gas buildup, venting, and external ignition. Its purpose is to evaluate the system's ability to prevent fire spread, explosions, and other secondary risks. This rigorous standard demands exceptional performance in areas such as system insulation, gas management, thermal runaway suppression, and overall engineering design. Against these stringent requirements, Sungrow's SBH Residential ESS successfully withstood a demanding 24-hour trial. Confronted with multiple challenges\u2014including closely spaced battery units, deactivated active fire suppression, continuous ignition triggers, and no external intervention\u2014the system demonstrated exceptional inherent safety controls, passing all evaluation criteria. Containing Fire Spread: Locking-In the Risk The SBH Residential ESS demonstrated unparalleled fire containment during the UL 9540B fire safety test, thanks to a range of advanced safety features, including cell-level fire-resistant insulation, bottom heat dissipation, and multi-directional pressure relief. During the test, when one unit ignited due to thermal runaway, the flames were confined to the pressure relief area. Adjacent units recorded internal surface temperatures of just 21\u00b0C\u2014well below the 154\u00b0C venting threshold\u2014while eave temperatures peaked at 35\u00b0C, far under the 150\u00b0C limit. Self-Extinguishing in 1 Hour: Stopping Fire at Source By leveraging structural designs that facilitate rapid heat dissipation and thermal isolation between modules, the SBH Residential ESS successfully confined thermal runaway to the bottom module. Without any fire suppression intervention, the open flames self-extinguished within one hour. Further ignition attempts over the next 24 hours resulted in no re-ignition, demonstrating the system's exceptional safety performance. Explosion & Projectile Prevention: Maximum Safety Assurance With the active fire suppression system disabled throughout testing, the SBH Residential ESS experienced no combustion events, explosions, or projectile hazards. The cabinet remained fully intact, showcasing outstanding fire resistance, explosion prevention, and structural stability. Building on its previous success in the UL 9540A Thermal Runaway Fire Propagation Test, the SBH Residential ESS has now passed the rigorous UL 9540B large-scale fire test. This accomplishment further validates the system's comprehensive safety capabilities, covering everything from cell-level thermal runaway suppression to full system-wide fire control. As a result, homeowners can have confidence in the SBH Residential ESS's superior safety performance in real-world fire scenarios. As a global leader in energy storage, Sungrow is committed to upholding the highest safety standards in the industry.

Concordia Shanghai Early Childhood Division Named Top 2 in China Released by KingLead Research, the ranking comprehensively evaluates based on field research and five core indicators: Infrastructure, Faculty, Curriculum Contents, Sustainability, and Social Evaluation. The No. 2 placement reflects Concordia's comprehensive strength and its leading role in early childhood education. Central to the division's success is its student-centered approach, with teachers acting as researchers and facilitators. Inspired by the \"the 100 languages\" concept of the Reggio Emilia philosophy, children express themselves in many ways, from drawing and building to music, movement, storytelling, dramatic play, and scientific exploration. Excellence remains a hallmark of Concordia education, but it is excellence grounded in purpose and character\u2014not achievement alone. While engaging in academic exploration, the younger learners are also building character development through meaningful play. \"This achievement reflects the collective commitment of our Early Childhood community,\" says Ms. Shannon Keane, Early Childhood Principal. \"At Concordia, we honor the belief that every child is capable, curious, and ready to take ownership of their learning. Through intentional play, our students develop belonging, identity, and the intellectual tools to make sense of their world. We are deeply grateful to our teachers and families who bring this vision to life.\" Concordia nurtures a collaborative and supportive learning environment that empowers students to become creative problem-solvers and compassionate members of the global community. The school's commitment to holistic development means it supports students not only academically, but also socially, emotionally, and spiritually.
