By introducing how Guizhou strives for high-quality economic growth and rural revitalization, the article showed China's unwavering determination to pursue high-quality development, which is key to its modernization drive. BEIJING, March 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- At this year's Two Sessions \u2013 China's annual legislative and political consultative sessions \u2013 high-quality development is a buzzword. The first local inspection tour made by Chinese President Xi Jinping after the Two Sessions has again revealed the country's unwavering determination to pursue high-quality development, which is key to its modernization drive. From Monday to Tuesday, Xi visited southwest China's Guizhou, calling on the province to adhere to high-quality development and drive growth by further deepening reform and opening up comprehensively. High-quality development in Chinese modernization During the tour, Xi pointed out high-quality development is an essential requirement for advancing Chinese modernization, urging Guizhou to pursue high-quality development by strengthening its economy, driving innovation, and transforming traditional industries, while also protecting its ecological environment. Once considered the \"poorest\" province, Guizhou has made remarkable progress, alleviating over 9.2 million people from poverty within a decade by 2021. In 2024, Guizhou's GDP reached 2.27 trillion yuan ($311.6 billion), growing by 5.3 percent compared to the previous year, higher than the national average growth rate of 5 percent. Often dubbed China's big-data hub, Guizhou is the country's first national big-data comprehensive pilot zone, promoting big-data industry as the backbone of its high-quality social and economic development. Currently, 47 major data centers are either under construction or operational across this province. Through relentless efforts in ecological conservation, the province \u2013 home to the largest area of rocky desertification in China \u2013 saw its forest coverage rise to 63 percent by the end of 2023, with 99.1 percent of days in Guizhou's major cities meeting excellent air quality standards in 2024. Culture confidence Stressing Guizhou is rich in historical, red culture and ethnic culture, Xi called on the province to preserve the traditional culture, enhance cultural confidence to boost economic and social development. When visiting the Zhaoxing Dong Village in Liping County on Monday, Xi and the villagers sat around a fire pit to discuss all-around rural revitalization at a drum tower, a unique architecture for the Dong ethnic group that serves as a communal gathering spot. Xi stressed that areas with large ethnic minority populations should preserve their distinctive culture and let it shine through the integrated development of culture and tourism. Tourism has become a major industry and rural tourism is thriving, Xi said, wishing the villagers' lives to continuously prosper with each passing day. In recent years, Zhaoxing Dong Village has vigorously developed the tourism industry by setting up more than 400 hotels, homestay hotels and restaurants, fostering more than 60 traditional handicraft enterprises and generating employment and entrepreneurship for more than 2,000 people. Last year, the village received 1.027 million visitors, an increase of 63.4 percent, with tourism revenue reaching 1.02 billion yuan, an increase of 63.8 percent. The village's collective economic income reached 2.45 million yuan, while the villagers' per capita disposable income rose to about 41,600 yuan, up by 12.3 percent. https://news.cgtn.com/news/2025-03-18/Xi-Jinping-inspects-Guizhou-stresses-high-quality-development-1BQgj2REwKc/p.html", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-03-19 05:26:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_priority": 1333464, "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/en_prnasisa.png", "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top"], "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": true}, {"article_id": "1c7a775bf7158738bf8eb298c565f488", "title": "\u0627\u0654\u0633\u0645\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u064a\u0645 \u062a\u0648\u0632\u0639 \u0627\u0654\u0631\u0628\u0627\u062d\u0627\u064b \u0646\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0646\u0633\u0628\u0629 8% \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0628\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0639 2024 -

This marked a modest increase of 1.2%, ending a three-year decline. Notably, the Greater China market has been on a downward trajectory for four consecutive years, with the fleet size shrinking by 6.23% year-on-year to 331 aircraft. In particular, the mainland market experienced a net reduction of 21 aircraft, emerging as the primary variable in the regional adjustment. During this period of significant industry restructuring, Sino Jet has maintained its position at the forefront with a fleet of 41 aircraft, securing the top spot as the leading business jet operator in the Asia-Pacific for the sixth consecutive time. It stands out as the only Chinese operator among the top five to achieve a strong fleet performance. Data reveals that Sino Jet has added several new business jets to its fleet this year, completing an upgrade of its fleet structure. Currently, over 95% of its fleet consists of large business jets, with the Gulfstream G650 series exceeding 20 aircraft, making it the world's largest G650 fleet. Sino Jet, being a full-chain operator encompassing aviation asset management, charter operations, ground support, business jet terminals, and luxury travel, has established a competitive edge in the business aviation sector through five strategic pillars: safety management, airworthiness qualifications, digital intelligence systems, global networks, and service ecosystems. Safety Management System Leading a Decade of IS-BAO Safety Excellence Sino Jet became the first in mainland China to achieve the International Standard for Business Aircraft Operations (IS-BAO) Stage III certification in 2018, the highest level of accreditation. The company has successfully undergone re-evaluations in both 2021 and 2024, resulting in a decade-long safety operation qualification. This system strictly follows the International Business Aviation Council's Safety Management System (SMS) standards, establishing a scientific, standardized, and long-term safety operation mechanism that provides a solid foundation for the company's long-term development. Global Airworthiness Qualification Matrix Enabling Multi-Jurisdictional Operations Sino Jet possesses dual Air Operator's Certificates (AOCs) granted by both the Civil Aviation Administration of China and the Cayman Islands, thereby establishing a \"domestic + international\" dual commercial charter operation model. The company boasts exceptional global operational capabilities, encompassing aircraft management services across nine major business jet registries, including China, the United States, Cayman, and San Marino. This positions Sino Jet as the leading enterprise in China's business jet industry, offering the most comprehensive operational and maintenance licenses and managing the widest range of aircraft registries. The fleet comprises mainstream models from top aircraft manufacturers such as Gulfstream, Bombardier, Dassault, Embraer, ACJ, and BBJ. Sino Jet has the capability to provide comprehensive maintenance and inspection services, underscoring its professional depth and resource integration in business jet management. Digital Intelligence Operation System Building a Digital Foundation for Aviation Asset Management Sino Jet, as a national high-tech enterprise, is redefining the value of business jet services through digital transformation. By developing an intelligent service system, the company delivers an experience that is efficient, transparent, and reassuring for its clients. The intelligent customer service system ensures precise responsiveness to client needs and efficient service closure, offering a round-the-clock, one-stop exclusive interaction experience. The digital operation system employs advanced technology to implement meticulous full-process control over flights, thereby guaranteeing the safety and punctuality of each journey. Meanwhile, the digital maintenance engineering management system facilitates comprehensive, full-life-cycle management of aircraft, from their introduction to retirement, ensuring the preservation of aircraft assets and enabling swift transactions and settlements. The integrated business and financial system allows for full-process visual tracking of expenses, making every cost clearly traceable and underscoring the quality and trustworthiness of the high-end services provided. Through these innovations, Sino Jet transforms the traditionally complex management of business jets into an exceptionally simple customer experience. This allows distinguished clients to concentrate on their core activities while enjoying a relaxed and seamless travel experience. Multi-Hub Operational Network Building Accompanying Service Capabilities With the \"Accompanying Strategy\" as its guiding principle, Sino Jet is dedicated to fulfilling the promise of \"Where the customer is, the service is there\", striving to deliver seamless global aviation services. Thanks to its robust global presence, Sino Jet has set up operational bases in more than 20 key cities worldwide, spanning major domestic cities such as Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, as well as international hubs across Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and North America. This strategic layout not only demonstrates Sino Jet's profound understanding of customer needs and its quick response capabilities but also, through effective global resource allocation and collaboration, offers customers customized aviation solutions around the clock and across regions. This approach truly embodies the brand value of \"Global Access, Borderless Service\". Full-Scenario Service Ecosystem Completing the Industrial Chain Value Loop In the realm of service system construction, Sino Jet transcends the limitations of conventional aviation services by expanding the service scenario beyond the air to encompass the entire ground chain, thereby crafting a one-stop luxury travel ecosystem. Through the establishment of its own aviation ground support company and strategic investments in four major FBOs located in Chengdu, Nanchang, Guangzhou, and Macao, Sino Jet has effectively constructed a \"Sky Corridor - Ground Hub - Asset Port\" trinity service matrix. This setup ensures a seamless connection from flight operations to ground support. Meanwhile, its luxury travel service deeply integrates top global resources, innovatively launching composite products such as \"Business Jet and Super Yacht\" and \"Business Jet and Self-Drive Adventure\". In addition to meeting the diverse and personalized travel needs of customers, this also significantly enhances customer experience and brand loyalty, forming a complete industrial chain value loop from service to value. The head of Sino Jet emphasized, \"Our commitment is to become the most trusted business aviation expert; we must fulfill our customers' needs for efficient and convenient travel while maximizing the preservation of their aircraft assets\". He further stated, \"We are redefining the industry's service benchmark by constructing a technology-driven, globally responsive, and full-industry-chain-empowered business system\". While many competitors remain focused on traditional business models, Sino Jet has already begun to shape the future of transportation. By leveraging its expertise in aircraft operations, resources, and its business jet terminal, along with its strategic integration with a leading eVTOL production company, Sino Jet is developing a \"Business Aviation + Low-Altitude Economy\" three-dimensional travel ecosystem. This innovative approach aims to bridge the \"last 100 kilometers\" of business jet travel, offering customers a comprehensive, high-quality door-to-door travel solution. Looking ahead, Sino Jet will maintain a keen focus on industry trends and market dynamics, continuously refining its development strategy and business model with a global perspective and forward-thinking approach. The company is dedicated to establishing itself as a global leader in the business aviation sector.
