The IncomeGuard Critical Illness Protector covers 121 critical illnesses and diseases, providing a market-first[1] heart attack/stroke continuous treatment benefit with up to 100% of the notional amount upon diagnosis of a heart attack or stroke for subsequent specified complex or major surgeries, following the receipt of major critical illness benefit. The IncomeShield Critical Illness Protector delivers focused protection for cancer, heart diseases, and stroke, featuring simplified underwriting with as few as three health questions. Together, these plans provide essential financial support tailored to the diverse needs of customers facing serious health challenges. Darren Thompson, Chief Product Officer_Manulife Hong Kong and Macau Manulife's research[3] reveals that consumers seeking critical illness coverage prioritize three key factors: coverage for a wide variety of critical illnesses (53%), the availability of various value-added services to support them during illness (39%), and coverage for recurring critical illnesses (37%). In addition, upon diagnosis, 39% of surveyed consumers identified their immediate concern, ranked among the top three, as losing their ability to work and their income-earning potential. This was closely followed by 34% who cited becoming a burden to their family and needing care as their next most pressing issue. Yet, even as they contemplate securing insurance coverage for critical illnesses, one of their top concerns is the higher premiums that come with increasing age (25%). These findings underscore the importance of financial stability in helping consumers focus on their recovery and providing them with peace of mind. The IncomeGuard Critical Illness Protector offers extensive coverage for 121 critical illnesses and diseases, including 60 major critical illnesses, 44 early-stage critical illnesses, and 17 juvenile diseases. Key features include: Extra coverage : Provides up to 100% extra critical illness coverage if the life insured is diagnosed with a major critical illness, an early-stage critical illness and/or juvenile disease, or passes away within the first 10 policy years[4]. This offers annual income support, with coverage of up to 1,000% of the notional amount[5] from diagnosis to treatment for cancer, heart attack, and stroke. [Market-first[1] ] Heart attack/stroke continuous treatment benefit: Upon diagnosis of a heart attack or stroke following the receipt of a major critical illness benefit, this feature offers extra protection with each payout of up to 100% of the notional amount for subsequent specified complex or major surgeries. Premium waiver: Premiums for the basic plan are waived for 12 months starting from the premium due date immediately after the diagnosis date of an early-stage critical illness or juvenile disease once benefits are paid. All future premiums for the basic plan are also waived following the diagnosis of a major critical illness after benefits are paid. Traditional Chinese medicine: Offers reimbursement for traditional Chinese medicine related to cancer treatment, supporting the recovery journey. Protection Restore Benefit: This benefit provides the total amount previously paid for an early-stage critical illness and juvenile disease that occurred at least a year ago if the life insured has a major critical illness or passes away before the age of 85, providing the life insured with much-needed financial support. Guaranteed premium: The premium amount remains unchanged throughout the payment period, with terms available for 10, 20, or 25 years.[6] The IncomeShield Critical Illness Protector is designed for customers seeking focused protection against cancer, heart diseases, and stroke. Key features include: Simplified underwriting: Answer just three health questions, mainly focused on health conditions from the past two years, provided that the insured has not been diagnosed with specified diseases. Steady financial support: This offers annual income support, with coverage of up to 500% of the notional amount[7] from diagnosis to treatment for cancer, heart attack, and stroke. [Market-first[1] ] Heart attack/stroke continuous treatment benefit: Upon diagnosis of a heart attack or stroke following the receipt of a major critical illness benefit, this feature offers extra protection with each payout of up to 100% of the notional amount for subsequent specified complex or major surgeries. Late-stage Cancer Advanced Benefit: Provides a one-time advanced payout equal to 100% of the notional amount upon diagnosis of late-stage cancer.[8] Premium waiver: All future premiums for the basic plan are waived after the diagnosis date of a major critical illness, once benefits are paid. Protection Restore Benefit: This benefit provides the total amount previously paid for an early-stage critical illness that occurred at least a year ago if the life insured has a major critical illness or passes away before the age of 85, providing the life insured with much-needed financial support. Guaranteed premium: The premium amount remains unchanged throughout the payment period, with terms available for 10, 20, or 25 years.[6] Darren Thompson, Chief Product Officer, Manulife Hong Kong and Macau, said: \"With rising medical costs and the financial burden of critical illnesses, it is essential for Manulife to offer our customers accessible and holistic insurance solutions that protect themselves and their loved ones during challenging times. While many consumers view critical illness plans as a means to cover treatment expenses, they also serve as a vital income replacement tool. When diagnosed with a critical illness, people often need to take time off for treatment and recovery, leading to significant income loss. This makes critical illness plans invaluable in providing financial stability, allowing individuals to focus on their treatment and recovery journey.\" To provide better support for customers diagnosed with cancer, Manulife's CancerCompanion Service[9], is now available as a value-added service through a Healthcare Hotline Team and Personalized Medical Case Managers[10], who are qualified nurses with extensive healthcare experience, to guide customers diagnosed with cancer through treatment and recovery. The services feature the industry-leading[11] Cancer Drug Support Service[12], which includes limousine service in collaboration with Prosper Health and Shenzhen New Frontier United Family Hospital, as well as a second medical opinion service to be provided by specialists at Gleneagles Hospital Hong Kong, HKSH Medical Group, CUHK Medical Centre, and all United Family Hospitals. Additionally, discounted cancer check-up packages and dietitian services are available through selected medical service providers[13],[14]. Terms and conditions apply.
