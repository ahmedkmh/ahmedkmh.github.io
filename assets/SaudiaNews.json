Debuts at CES 2026, Accelerating Globalization Strategy", "description": "LAS VEGAS, Jan. 7, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- This year's CES welcomes a new player. On January 6, Nebula Next made its debut at CES, officially unveiling the concept car Nebula Next 01 Concept. This showcase highlights its avant-garde design language and forward-looking exploration of high-performance new energy vehicle (NEV) architectures. As an innovative tech company focused on R&D and product exploration, this debut signifies that Nebula Next has entered a new stage of development. As the global benchmark for technology trends, CES serves not only as the premier showcase for the fusion of automotive and technology innovation but also as a strategic hub for enterprises to link global resources and deepen international cooperation. Currently, the global smart electric vehicle (EV) industry is in a critical cycle of accelerated technological iteration and competitive restructuring. Leading companies are actively deploying global strategies to seize the technological high ground and early market advantages. CES, therefore, stands as the core arena for testing corporate global competitiveness. This global debut marks a significant milestone in Nebula Next's development. The Nebula Next 01 Concept unveiled deeply interprets the brand's pursuit of ultimate efficiency and performance. Its front-end design centers on multifunctional aerodynamic structures, elevating intake management and cooling efficiency to new heights \u2013 addressing energy loss challenges faced by luxury EVs at high speeds. The side profile combines dynamic aesthetics with integrated active airflow features, ensuring optimal power balance during high-speed driving. The rear features active aerodynamic components and an innovative crash structure design, optimizing airflow while balancing vehicle aesthetics with safety, achieving a harmony of luxury feel, driving performance, and safety protection. Beyond its engineering precision, the Nebula Next 01 Concept elevates the brand spirit to \"Dare to beat.\" More than a slogan, this is a will to challenge nature and limits\u2014Dare to beat the wind, Dare to beat the flash, and Dare to beat the rules. Visually, the vehicle captures the rare energy of \"Green Lightning\" found in superstorms, featuring a sharp \"Lightning Waistline\" that redefines the body's Golden Ratio and projects muscular power even when standing still. It is this \"Dare to beat\" persistence that drove the team to develop an ultra-rigid, deep-woven Blue Carbon Fiber as the vehicle's \"armor.\" This innovation underpins the car's extreme performance in \"Super Track Mode\" . This is not just a pursuit of speed, but a bold declaration by Star Project to defy convention and rewrite the rules of performance and safety. Currently, the global luxury new energy market is in a critical period of electrification transformation. Consumer perception of luxury has shifted from \"brand premium\" to \"technology premium + experience upgrade,\" providing differentiated competitive opportunities for new brands with core technical advantages. As a \"born global\" automaker, Nebula Next has targeted the global market from inception, committing to a development path that avoids competing on price and instead builds a high-end brand through technological value. Leveraging a maturing smart EV supply chain, Nebula Next aims to seize key moments of technological evolution and market demand, redefining traditional luxury performance and innovating intelligent experiences to break through the existing market structure. The implementation of core technologies and the advancement of global strategy depend on a high-quality talent team and supply chain system \u2013 core elements of global competition for automotive enterprises today. Since its official announcement, Nebula Next's business operations have progressed steadily. It has assembled a vehicle manufacturing team of nearly 1,000 people that continues to expand. The team not only includes senior experts and veterans from traditional vehicle manufacturing \u2013 covering R&D, production, supply chain management, and marketing channels \u2013 but also cultivates a group of core internal leaders with deep methodology and product innovation experience in the intelligent hardware sector. This forms an organizational structure driven by a \"Smart + Manufacturing\" dual DNA. Nebula Next has launched a user co-creation system. Through preliminary research in major global new energy vehicle markets, real user feedback is directly integrated into product iteration and design optimization to create a co-created product experience. Subsequently, Nebula Next will formulate differentiated product implementation and service strategies based on the market demands and policy environments of different regions. At the same time, Nebula Next has reached strategic partnerships with multiple top-tier global suppliers, integrating global supply chain advantages to lay a solid foundation for the industrialization of future R&D results. This CES debut marks a significant opportunity for Nebula Next to engage deeply with the global automotive ecosystem. Through multi-regional R&D collaboration, global supply chain integration, and differentiated market strategies, Nebula Next is advancing its globalization journey at a steady pace. Looking ahead, Nebula Next will continue focusing on core technology development, deepening global resource synergy, and leveraging R&D strength as its driving force to deliver superior smart mobility experiences for users worldwide \u2013 contributing to the high-quality transformation of the global automotive industry toward electrification and intelligence.

(NASDAQ: UCL) - uCloudlink's patent CloudSIM\u00ae and AI HyperConn\u00ae technology, is redefining the boundaries of mobile connectivity at CES 2026. Driven by a mission to eliminate the \"Cross-Border\" and \"Cross-Network\" Digital Divides, uCloudlink today introduced a matrix of game-changing devices designed to ensure data flows as freely as air and water. uCloudlink Redefines the Boundaries of Mobile Connectivity at CES 2026 This year, GlocalMe\u00ae, a digital lifestyle sub-brand under uCloudlink, lineup tackles connectivity from three game-changing dimensions: 1. The Ultimate Mobile Communications Hub: MeowGo G50 Max \u2013 At the forefront is the MeowGo G50 Max, an AI-powered connectivity hub that integrates \"orbital, in-flight, and ground-based\" networks. The core functionality includes the ability to create a mobile WiFi Hotspot anywhere terrestrial networks are available. However, unlike other mobile WiFi hotspot devices, the MeowGo G50 Max is not a paperweight when operating in areas outside terrestrial coverage. It Moves beyond traditional hotspots, by incorporating the ability to connect to Skylo's 3GPP Release 17 standard compliance Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN). Space (The Safety Net): Through a strategic partnership with Skylo, the industry leader in software-defined Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), the G50 Max offers seamless satellite connectivity without bulky external antennas. Although broadband internet features are not available when connecting to satellite, the device does offer services such as critical two-way messaging and Emergency SOS capabilities in the 70 percent of the globe that lacks cellular coverage\u2014from deep-sea fishing expeditions to cross-desert treks. Air & Ground (The Speed): Managed by uCloudlink's AI HyperConn\u00ae, the device delivers a frictionless roaming experience through its signature \"One Device, One Account\" capability. It intelligently manages credentials for home, office, hotel, and in-flight Wi-Fi alongside cellular and satellite connections. By automatically selecting the best signals from multiple terrestrial operators and enabling seamless switching between these diverse networks without manual logins or intervention, it ensures users always enjoy the optimal connection\u2014delivering maximum value at a smart cost\u2014to eliminate connectivity anxiety. 2. The \"Invisible Wi-Fi\" Revolution: UniCord Series \u2013 Addressing the \"Lightweight Travel\" trend, uCloudlink unveils the UniCord Series (including Pro and Plus) and the RoamPlug. By embedding high-performance CloudSIM hotspots directly into essential daily items like fast-charging cables and travel adapters, uCloudlink makes hardware practically invisible. This eliminates the burden of carrying extra devices while ensuring a secure, private global connection superior to unsecured public Wi-Fi. 3. The Disruptor: eSIM Trio Targeting the massive untapped market of more than 4 billion devices with physical SIM slots, the eSIM Trio acts as a \"Global Super Black Card.\" It brings the flexibility of CloudSIM and eSIM functionality to most iPhones and a wide range of Android devices, effectively \"eSIM-izing\" legacy handsets. This innovation allows users to switch between global carriers without changing SIM cards\u2014a game-changing product that reactivates the physical slot market. The \"Invisible Wi-Fi\" Revolution: UniCord Series eSIM Trio: A Game-changing \"Global Super Black Card\" \"From the remote wilderness to the urban jungle, from home to office to in-flight, our goal is to bridge every digital divide,\" said Jeff Chen, the CEO and Co-Founder of uCloudlink. \"With the MeowGo G50 Max now Skylo-certified, and our invisible Wi-Fi solutions, we are not just launching products; we are building the infrastructure for a seamless, connected future.\" About Skylo Technologies Skylo Technologies is an NTN service provider based in Mountain View, CA, offering a service that allows cellular devices to connect directly over existing satellites.
