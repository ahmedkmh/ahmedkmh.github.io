Dr. Wee Ka Siong Champions Malaysia's Education Future with Launch of TAR UMT Arena", "description": "Distinguished UTM alumnus leads the unveiling of a world-class 1.5 million sq. ft. hub designed to transform higher education, innovation, and youth development in Malaysia KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Dec. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Datuk Seri Ir. Dr. Wee Ka Siong, a distinguished alumnus of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) and one of Malaysia's most respected engineers and policymakers, has once again demonstrated his enduring national influence through the official unveiling of the TAR UMT Arena, a 1.5 million square-foot facility that redefines the country's approach to higher education and holistic student development. The landmark event, attended by prominent leaders from education, industry, and government, marks a significant investment in the nation's future talent. Dr. Wee (second from left) presenting the TAR UMT Arena FIFA-certified football field certificate Engineering Leadership with Societal ImpactDr. Wee's stewardship of this 2025 milestone project reflects a lifelong commitment to nation-building through education and innovation. Widely recognized for his tenure as Malaysia's Minister of Transport (2020\u20132022), he guided the nation's logistics and transport sectors through the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining supply chain resilience and ensuring critical infrastructure projects advanced uninterrupted. Beyond transportation, Dr. Wee has held senior national positions including Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, where he championed SME development, and Deputy Minister of Education, where he emphasized equitable access and quality reform. His recent appointment in late 2024 as an investment advisor for the Chinese community in Malaysia, with a specific focus on the halal industry further underscores his capacity to bridge engineering expertise with economic foresight, translating technical knowledge into sustainable national growth. Dr. Wee's career illustrates that engineering is more than building infrastructure, rather it is about designing opportunities that empower people and strengthen nations. Through his leadership in transport, education, and economic policy, he has continuously shaped Malaysia's trajectory toward a knowledge-driven, innovation-led future. The TAR UMT Arena stands as a tangible legacy of this vision, a living symbol of Malaysia's commitment to holistic education, sustainable innovation, and youth empowerment. Dr. Wee's continued contributions inspire a generation of leaders to think boldly, act responsibly, and serve with purpose in a rapidly evolving global landscape. Embedded in UTM's qualityThis extensive career in public policy and infrastructure is built on a deep technical foundation from UTM itself. As a proud double alumnus of UTM, Dr. Wee holds both a Bachelor of Civil Engineering and a PhD in Transportation Planning, academic credentials that have profoundly shaped his evidence-based and solution-oriented approach to policymaking. Currently, Dr. Wee serves as an active member on several professional engineers' organisations including the Institution of Engineers Malaysia (MIEM) and Road Engineering Association of Asia & Australasia (REAAA). His professional path which combines technical mastery with public policy leadership stands as a powerful testament to the leadership and strategic capabilities fostered within Malaysian higher education. Therefore, Dr. Wee's journey from from a university engineering student to a PhD, and ultimately to a national-level minister and educational leader exemplifies UTM's vision of cultivating graduates who integrate scientific knowledge, innovation, and social responsibility.

The core architecture of the AI platform comprises four main modules: the large model computing power scheduling platform, which integrates diverse computing resources to enhance efficiency; the knowledge operation platform that aggregates authoritative union data, professional policies and regulations, and typical cases, featuring automatic categorization, dynamic updates, and precise retrieval capabilities; the large model service management platform, enabling end-to-end management from model training to deployment and lowering the barrier for union staff to use AI technologies; and the trade union native AI application support platform, providing foundational support for the development of intelligent applications. The AI platform has integrated three key elements of AI: computing power, models and data. It helps enhance the performance of trade union-specific industry models in knowledge processing, reasoning and other areas, boosting the intelligence and efficiency of union work. Currently, this platform has been applied to multiple scenarios in trade union work. The intelligent legal service provides personalized legal consultations; smart data analytics quickly obtains data chart analysis results through interactive methods; the trade union-specific Q&A system, trade union language, offers more authoritative trade union-specific responses compared to general models; the writing assistant can assist in drafting 15 types of statutory documents and five types of administrative documents. The launch of the AI platform marks a shift in union services from being experience-driven to data-driven, and from achieving isolated breakthroughs to enabling systemic transformation. By equipping union operations with a digital engine, the platform represents a critical step forward in the digital and intelligent transformation of trade unions in China, officials of the ACFTU said. In addition to the AI infrastructure, the digitalized service terminals of the ACFTU designed for direct engagement with workers have achieved notable results. The \"workers' home\" app, designed for hundreds of millions of workers, has acted as a crucial window for delivering capabilities since it was launched on July 1, 2024. Data showed that over the past year and more, the \"workers' home\" app has recorded cumulative activity visits of 440 million, attracted over 14.5 million registered users, and seen activity participation reach 300 million person-times. The app focuses on key areas such as the reform of building a strong industrial workforce, safeguarding workers' rights, and serving key groups including workers in new forms of employment. Its 10 functional zones have been progressively enhanced. Among them, the \"workers' service zone\" offers 27 types of services. As of now, more than 410 activities have been organized through the \"workers' home\" app. The app features 200,000 trade union service facilities. It has attracted 334,000 trade union organizations and assisted membership registration and transfers for over 3.37 million individuals. The \"trade union's digital ID wallet\" enables functions such as identity verification, rights inquiry and benefit redemption. It has distributed more than 270,000 mobile health checkup vouchers, 135,000 copies of employee mutual insurance and 792,000 worker care packages. To date, the \"workers' home\" app has been integrated with the systems of 31 provincial-level trade union federations, incorporating 188 localized applications. Beyond infrastructure and platform development, the digital and intelligent transformation is reflected in the ACFTU emphasis on enhancing workers' digital skills as a key task in deepening the reform of the industrial workforce. Initiatives include the creation of the \"cloud for workers' innovation and creation\" and the \"cloud for workers' skills enhancement\", the launch of digital courses on platforms such as the \"craftsmen academy\" and the \"workers' home\" app, and the implementation of programs to improve digital skills among female workers. Trade unions across the country have strengthened collaboration with government departments at corresponding levels, exploring models such as \"digitalization + training\", \"digitalization + competition\" and \"digitalization + services\", tailored to local and industry-specific conditions. According to the ACFTU, during the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30), it will expand the participation scope, broaden the range of occupations covered, and enhance the utilization of outcomes in digital competitions. Efforts will also be made to advance digital skills training, promote innovation outcomes, and cultivate craftsmen with digital skills. Leveraging the \"craftsmen academy\", enterprise training bases and the \"workers' home\" app, courses in areas such as AI and smart manufacturing will be offered both online and offline. These initiatives will include digital skills training; exhibitions of \"five small\" innovations featuring inventions, creations, renovations, designs and suggestions; and activities to assist the practical application of innovations.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["men", "cpr", "stm", "pub", "afi", "ite"], "creator": null, "language": "english", "country": ["yemen",

International-Level Jewelry Art with Three Aesthetic Concepts", "description": "TAIPEI, Dec. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- T.THREE Jewelry founder and jewelry artist Chia-Chen Wu creates a unique style of Eastern jewelry art centered on three core aesthetic concepts: \"flowing lines, artistic transitions, and sculptural layers.\" His brand insists on pure handcraftsmanship and artistic creation, emphasizing the wearer's temperament and striving to make jewelry an extension of taste, inner qualities, and charm. (Article source from T.THREE news) A new fashion vocabulary of Eastern aesthetics, integrating across disciplines and utilizing diverse media, Wu Chia-Chen's creations move from \"observing needs\" to \"fulfilling needs.\" He utilizes brainstorming and the extension of consciousness, combining multiple elements, media, and expertise from multiple fields to shape a new era of jewelry aesthetics. He believes that the greatest achievement of free design comes from the infinite extension of thought, thus transforming everyday, personalized inspiration into jewelry vocabulary imbued with emotion and meaning. Through the flow of metal lines, the harmony of gemstone colors, and the dialogue of material textures, his works create visual tension with sculptural layers, presenting a unique artistic style. Taiwan's jewelry industry has made its mark on the international stage with numerous exhibitions, including: 2009 Cross-Strait Jewelry Culture Exchange Exhibition; 2010 \"A Magnificent Encounter of Metalwork and Gemstones\"; 2011 Solo Exhibition \"Bionic Jewelry and Metalwork Creation\"; 2012 Beijing Caibai \"Jewelry Design Masters Forum\" Joint Exhibition; 2013 Louvre International Art Exhibition (Asia Exhibition); 2014 Former French President Raffarin's visit to the Louvre Carrousel; 2015 The First Paris International Art Fair (Pierre Cardin Art Center); 2019 Farglory Museum \"Louvre Taiwan Award-Winning Artists Joint Exhibition\"; and 2019 \"Wu Chia-Chen \u00d7 Lin Yi-Wen: Fashion Masterpieces Duo Exhibition.\" Fashion Show Collaborations | The Artistic Allure of Jewelry on the Runway: 2013 Shenzhen Cultural Fair International Jewelry Exhibition, 2014 Louvre Museum East-West Art Exhibition (Kaohsiung Tour), 2019 Double Jewelry Show (Farglory Museum THE ONE), 2022 Lin Huang Palace \u00d7 Classic Cheongsam \u00d7 Jewelry Crossover Show, 2023 Kaohsiung Marriott Hotel T.THREE Jewelry Show, 2024 Lin Huang Palace \"Neoclassical Beauty Gathering\" Jewelry Show. Notably, collaborations have included appearances by Miss Asia contestants and prominent socialites, including a performance by Miss Asia third runner-up Yu Hsiao-han showcasing her award-winning piece from the Louvre Museum International Art Exhibition. Wu Chia-chen's designs have garnered numerous international accolades, including: First Prize (four pieces) at the 2009 Tainan County Government Orchid Craft Competition; First Place at the 2009 Meiho University of Science and Technology Jewelry Design Competition; Honorable Mention at the 2011 Pingtung Centennial Jewelry Design Competition; Gold Medal at the 2013 Louvre International Art Exhibition (Asia Region); and Jury Member (Taiwan Region) for Jewelry at the 2015 Paris International Art Fair. His works are collected by numerous political figures and artists from various countries, including: Tsai Chia-ju, Goodwill Ambassador of Palau; Paine, wife of the Haitian Ambassador; Abigail Beatrice, Ambassador of Eswatini; Bertrick, Mayor of Moret, France (whose representative work is in his collection); Dominique, President of the French Calligraphers and Painters Association; Boonky Ho, a national treasure painter; Li Chi-mao, a master of ink painting (who personally inscribed the calligraphy: \"Mr. Chia-chen - A Master of Exquisite Craftsmanship in the East\"); and Li Teng-sheng, another master of ink painting. These collections demonstrate the international artistic value and cultural influence of his works. Wu Chia-chen's design philosophy begins with the gemstones themselves, following a structure of development, transition, and conclusion. He explains that jewelry creation, like the rhythm of art, is built upon this framework: Development | Centered on the main stone to draw the eye; Development | Layered metal structure; Transition | Flowing lines and turning points create dynamic beauty; Conclusion | The gemstone's color, shape, and base merge into a unified aesthetic; Emotion | Infusing the piece with emotion and meaning, allowing it to resonate with the wearer. He quotes the artist Schiller, \"Thoughts have no boundaries,\" emphasizing that jewelry art should break free from constraints, presenting a unique and profound beauty through boundless design. Rooted in Taiwan, Wu Chia-chen aims to bring jewelry aesthetics to the world. He cherishes the aspiration of enabling Taiwanese jewelry design to stand tall on the international stage. With cultural heritage as its foundation and innovative aesthetics as its wings, he uses his work to build an artistic bridge between Taiwan and the world, making T.THREE jewelry a new force in Eastern art that has garnered international attention.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["rea", "hou", "jwl"], "creator": null, "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top", "lifestyle"], "datatype": "news", "pubDate": "2025-12-19 04:22:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://mma.prnasia.com/media2/2849404/image_800964_8001440.jpg?p=medium600", "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 4111305, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/en_prnasisa.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": false}], "nextPage": "1766118120280351544"}
