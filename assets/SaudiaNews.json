Among other findings, the study revealed that in the worst case, local consumers are up to 65 times more likely to be infected with malware when using piracy sites as compared to legitimate websites. The report, titled \"Consumer Risk from Piracy in Southeast Asia,\" explored activity in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Study author Dr. Paul Watters is a cybersecurity researcher and thought leader at Cyberstronomy Pty Ltd., Honorary Professor of Security Studies and Criminology at Macquarie University, and Professor of Information Systems at Holmesglen Institute. \"As this study makes clear, the risks and ramifications substantially increase for those in Southeast Asia who visit piracy sites,\" said Watters. \"Though efforts to curb digital piracy are ongoing, these stark results require additional action \u2013 such as smart tools and proven measures \u2013 to mitigate the relevant digital threats in each country.\" Overall, the study concluded that piracy sites\u2014including streaming piracy platforms, P2P networks, IPTV services, scam portals, anime piracy sites, and manga repositories\u2014carry a cyber threat risk more than 22 times higher than that of mainstream legitimate sites. \"The research findings reaffirm the extensive harms piracy networks inflict upon consumers and the economy in Southeast Asia,\" said Larissa Knapp, Executive Vice President and Chief Content Protection Officer for the Motion Picture Association. \"We applaud Dr. Watters and his team for their work in revealing the dangers of using these illicit sources, and we look forward to further collaboration with law enforcement throughout the region to detect these bad actors, deter future misdeeds, and dismantle unlawful operations that endanger a thriving creative marketplace.\" Other key findings from the study include: In the worst case, peer-to-peer (\"P2P\") networks, scam portals, and streaming piracy sites carry the highest relative risks of cyber threats. Consumers in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia have the highest average relative risk of encountering a cyber threat from a piracy service - each approaching or exceeding a 34-fold increase over legitimate sites. By contrast, the study uncovered almost no cyber risks on the most popular mainstream (non-piracy) websites in the region. The full study is available here.

This one-of-a-kind partnership combines co-branded fashion drops and a two-day immersive pop-up, blurring the line between energy and ease to unlock a fresh new perspective on modern luxury. W Hotels \u00d7 MondaySleepingClub: A Limited-Time Collaboration W Hotels \u00d7 MondaySleepingClub: A Limited-Time Collaboration W Hotels \u00d7 MondaySleepingClub: A Limited-Time Collaboration Inspired by the contrast and connection between the two brands, the collaboration is anchored in the mantra \"Sound On. Mind Off.\" \"Sound On.\" represents W Hotels' longtime passion for music, igniting the senses through curated playlists, live DJ sets, and the brand's iconic Sound Suites. From the heart of New York City to Asia's trendsetting neighborhoods, W Hotels has consistently challenged the norms of traditional hotel experiences through sound, scene, and self-expression. \"Mind Off.\" embodies the core philosophy of MondaySleepingClub, an aesthetic of calm, comfort, and cultural detachment that celebrates slowing down in a world that rarely does. \"We're excited to partner with MondaySleepingClub to create a space that is both high-energy and introspective, an unexpected harmony of rhythm and rest,\" said Bart Buiring, Managing Director, Luxury, Greater China, Marriott International. \"This collaboration reflects W Hotels' commitment to pushing boundaries and creating experiences that speak to a new generation of culturally driven luxury travelers.\" W Hotels \u00d7 MondaySleepingClub Unveil a Fresh Take on Elevated Streetwear CO-CREATED FOR SELF-EXPRESSION Two exclusive pieces bring the collaboration to life: a washed charcoal oversized tee and a classic black-and-white baseball cap. The palette draws inspiration from W Hotels' refreshed visual identity, featuring monochrome, modern, and unmistakable elements. Clean-lined graphics, including the signature \"Sound On. Mind Off.\" mantra and a hand-drawn sketch of W New York \u2013 Union Square, layer in storytelling. On the back of the tee, a lone figure immersed in vinyl sits beneath the hotel's iconic fac\u0327ade, a quiet ode to the harmony between outward rhythm and inward stillness, and a subtle nod to W Hotels' deep-rooted connection to music culture. The collection will be available for purchase at the Shanghai event and, in limited quantities, at select W Hotels across Greater China.
