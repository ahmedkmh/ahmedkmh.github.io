Non-IFRS Measures To supplement the Group's consolidated financial statements that are presented in accordance with the IFRS, the Group also uses Adjusted Net Profit (non-IFRS measure), Adjusted Net Profit margin (Non-IFRS measure), Adjusted EBITDA (non-IFRS measure), Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-IFRS measure), Store-level EBITDA (non-IFRS measure) and Store-level EBITDA margin (non-IFRS measure) as additional financial measures, which are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. \"Store-level EBITDA\" is defined as store-level operating profit for the period and adding back depreciation of plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets in store-level. \"Store-level EBITDA margin\" is calculated by dividing Store-level EBITDA by revenue for the same period. \"Adjusted Net Profit\" is defined as profit for the period and adding back share-based compensation. \"Adjusted Net Profit margin\" is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Profit by revenue for the same period. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is defined as Adjusted Net Profit for the period and adding back depreciation and amortization (excluding depreciation of right-of-use assets), income tax expense and interest income and expenses, net. \"Adjusted EBITDA margin\" is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenue for the same period. The Group believes that these non-IFRS measures facilitate comparisons of operating performance from period to period and company to company. The Group believes that these measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Group's results of operations in the same manner as they help the Group's management. However, the Group's presentation of Adjusted Net Profit (non-IFRS measure), Adjusted Net Profit margin (non-IFRS measure), Adjusted EBITDA (non-IFRS measure), Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-IFRS measure), Store-level EBITDA (non-IFRS measure) and Store-level EBITDA margin (non-IFRS measure) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The use of such non-IFRS measures has limitations as an analytical tool, and shareholders and potential investors of the Company should not consider them in isolation from, or as substitute for analysis of, the Group's results of operations or financial condition as reported under IFRS. Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this document and/or the Announcement are forward-looking statements that are, by their nature, subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Any statements that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, future events, or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as \"will\", \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"estimate\", \"believe\", \"going forward\", \"ought to\", \"may\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"intend\", \"plan\", \"projection\", \"could\", \"vision\", \"goals\", \"aim\", \"aspire\", \"objective\", \"target\", \"schedules\", and \"outlook\") are not historical facts, are forward-looking and may involve estimates and assumptions and are subject to risks (including but not limited to the risk factors detailed in this document and/or the Announcement), uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond the Company's control. Accordingly, these factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. The Company's forward-looking statements have been based on assumptions and factors concerning future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Those assumptions and factors are based on information currently available to the Company about the businesses that it operates. The risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company's control, that could influence actual results include, but are not limited to: the Company's operations and business prospects; its business and operating strategies and ability to implement such strategies; its ability to develop and manage its operations and business; its ability to control costs and expenses; its ability to identify and satisfy customer demands and preferences; the actions and developments of its competitors; general economic, political and business conditions in the markets in which it operates; and changes to regulatory and operating conditions in the industry and geographical markets in which it operates. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and, except as required by the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited or under applicable law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Since actual results or outcomes could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, the Company's shareholders and potential investors are advised not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements and to exercise caution in dealing in securities in the Company.
