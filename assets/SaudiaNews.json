(the \"Company\", Stock Code: 0658.HK, together with its subsidiaries, the \"Group\") today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Nanjing High Accurate Drive Equipment Manufacturing Group Co., Ltd. (\"Nanjing Drive\"), Nanjing Handa Import and Export Trade Co., Ltd. (\"Nanjing Handa\") and Nanjing Shengzhuang Supply Chain Co., Ltd. (\"Nanjing Shengzhuang\", together with Nanjing Drive and Nanjing Handa, the \"Relevant Subsidiaries\"), issued a writ of summons (HCA 656/2025) in the High Court of Hong Kong on 31 March 2025. The Legal Proceedings The action is brought against the following defendants (the \"Defendants\"): (1) Fang Jian (former Executive Director of the Company and former Legal Representative of the Relevant Subsidiaries), (2) Fullshare Holdings Limited (\"Fullshare\", Stock Code: 0607.HK), (3) Five Seasons XVI Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fullshare, (4) Ji Changqun (Chairman and Executive Director of Fullshare), (5) 16 other companies (the \"Counterparties\") which are counterparties to certain agreements for the sale and purchase of commodities (the \"Agreements\"), and (6) 10 other individuals who were Fullshare personnel improperly involved in the administration, financial management and contract approval of the Relevant Subsidiaries. The claim is based on the alleged wrongful conduct of the Defendants, which resulted in the loss of RMB 6.64 billion (the \"Relevant Amounts\") of the Relevant Subsidiaries. The legal action reflects the Group's commitment to safeguarding the interests of all shareholders, particularly minority shareholders, in light of potential unlawful activities by the Defendants. \"Our Board takes this matter very seriously and has taken decisive steps to protect the Group's interests and uphold our obligations to shareholders,\" said Hu Jichun, Chairman of the Group. \"We are duty-bound to rectify any misconduct that undermines corporate governance and shareholder value. We will pursue all necessary legal remedies to ensure accountability and transparency.\" Key Considerations As of 31 October 2024, receivables and pre-payments due to the Relevant Subsidiaries under the Agreements totaled approximately RMB 6.64 billion. Demand letters were sent to the Counterparties, which were not properly answered. Amongst the limited replies received, the Counterparties claimed that amounts owed were transferred to third parties following instructions from the Relevant Subsidiaries. The Relevant Subsidiaries have reported to the authorities in the PRC, which have, after vetting, initiated formal criminal investigation into suspected embezzlement and misappropriation of the Relevant Subsidiaries' funds and assets by individual(s) in position(s) of authority. Whilst the details surrounding the Relevant Amounts are still under independent investigation and formal criminal investigation, the Company and the Relevant Subsidiaries have been advised of the following: Meeting minutes, commercial records and communication records of the Relevant Subsidiaries indicate that Fullshare personnel, reporting to Ji Changqun, were improperly involved in the decision-making and management of the trading business of the Relevant Subsidiaries for which the Agreements were signed. According to Nanjing Drive's employees interviewed and financial records reviewed, Fullshare's financial personnel and accountants directly handled various payments between the Relevant Subsidiaries and the Counterparties; Financial records of the Relevant Subsidiaries were recovered from Fullshare's premises at Fengsheng Science Park in December 2024, after repeated demands from the current management of Nanjing Drive, demonstrating the potential control of Fullshare over the financials of the Relevant Subsidiaries; There existed a parallel contract approval procedure of the Relevant Subsidiaries where former legal counsel and other former or current executives of Fullshare were substantively involved; Crucially, public company search records show that certain Counterparties, which received the funds of the Relevant Subsidiaries, could be related to Ji Changqun or Fullshare. Nanjing Drive's current and former employees also indicated that the Counterparties are indirectly connected to Fullshare; and Fang Jian was responsible for the operation and management of the Relevant Subsidiaries when the Agreements were executed. Fang Jian also oversaw the management and approval of the company seal for these subsidiaries at the relevant time. In view of the above, the Relevant Subsidiaries have started to pursue the Defendants named in the legal action for the Relevant Amounts. Further defendants may be added to the proceedings as the investigations progress. Actions taken Upon discovering the Agreements, the Board promptly formed an Independent Investigation Committee to oversee an investigation into the matter. An independent investigative consultant was engaged and is expected to deliver a preliminary report of its findings by mid-May. The Board and the Group have reiterated their unwavering commitment to strengthening the Group's internal controls and have to date implemented interim remedial measures, including: Enhanced oversight and control of commodities trading operations Streamlined cash flow controls and inventory management Optimized senior management roles to ensure robust corporate governance Heightened management oversight and compliance - END - About the Group China High Speed Transmission Equipment Group Co., Ltd.

The Cities Shaping the Future examines the business environments of 1,500 cities in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America with populations greater than 250,000. The report was developed to assist multinational corporations identify new manufacturing sites and expand their sales networks to emerging consumers. The Oliver Wyman Forum ranked the cities based on consumer activity, access to suppliers and shipping, regional and global transportation connectivity, and climate resilience. Together, the cities represent 45% of global GDP and 85% of the world's population. The study applies proprietary urban research models developed by Oliver Wyman as well as advanced geospatial data gathering. \"Sustainable economic growth, climate change and protectionism are prompting corporations to review and reconsider their geographic footprints,\" said Ben Simpfendorfer, lead of the Oliver Wyman Forum initiatives in Asia. \"As a strategic planning tool, this report can help multinationals identify future opportunities and manage risks. Many of these cities will be among the world's largest megalopolises by the end of this decade.\" Findings show that Asia has multiple mid-tier cities benefiting from national industrial policy, supply chain shifts, and tourism. These cities account for 79 of the top 100 export centers, including Ho Chi Minh, and many have invested in advanced technologies, such as Shenzhen. Some key Asian export centers are uniquely exposed to climate change, however, owing to a greater number of coastal locations. Six Middle East cities rank among the top 50 commercial hubs, with Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Riyadh expanding rapidly. Several are aviation hubs with long-haul connections to Asia, Africa and Europe. Moreover, regional companies are increasingly listing on public equity exchanges. The report notes that expanding industrial capacity will be the key to whether they can match Asian peers. In Latin America, Mexico's scale as a supplier to the United States now rivals China, while a growing number of Latin American cities offer alternatives to Asia. Multiple cities have built modern mobility hubs, including Panama City and Bogota. While climate risks in the region are rising, extreme heat and water scarcity are more moderate than in the Middle East and some Asian cities. Africa has significant growth potential and faces fewer climate risks than either Asia or the Middle East. Improved transit and shipping connectivity are necessary to tap export opportunities, according to the report. The region's inter-continental mobility supporting tourism to the North is strong, with Addis Ababa as a standout. North Africa's major cities, such as Cairo or Tangiers, are the continent's export champions with long established industries but many of Africa's growing commercial hubs need improved urban planning, especially intra-city mobility. The report contains illustrated comparisons of populations and narrative profiles of key cities. Profiles in the report score cities on climate resilience and rank them as Commercial Hubs, Export Champions, and Mobility Connectors.
