As more users seek practical upgrades to their everyday routines, HEISR reintroduces its patented wrap-around design known for deeper inner-surface cleaning, up to 75% faster brushing, and a noticeably gentler experience for sensitive gums. 3-sided electric toothbrush for deeper interdental cleaning and sensitive-gum care \u2014 a perfect Black Friday gift for kids and the whole family. A New Approach to Everyday Oral Hygiene Rather than relying on stronger motors or additional modes, HEISR redesigned the brushing method itself. The patented wrap-around head reaches the inner, outer, and chewing surfaces simultaneously, targeting gumline and tongue-side areas that standard brushes often miss. Many users report a more even clean without needing to think about brushing angles. Another defining feature is the 0.01 mm ultra-soft bristle system, engineered to protect enamel while gliding comfortably along the gums. This design is especially helpful for children, who often struggle to brush evenly or reach hidden surfaces. By covering multiple sides at once, the HEISR brush helps kids achieve more complete cleaning even with inconsistent brushing motions. Long-term users continue to highlight the difference. One reviewer shared, \"Every corner is reached \u2014 even my dentist praised my clean teeth.\" Others describe the brushing experience as effortless, including users with braces or limited mobility. The model also includes soft-pressure control, multiple cleaning modes, IPX7 waterproofing, and long battery life suitable for both daily use and travel. What U.S. Users Are Saying U.S. customers continue to praise the brush for its efficiency and comfort, with many noting that the 3-sided design delivers a noticeably more complete clean. One Amazon reviewer wrote, \"The wraparound head hugs each tooth, and I can actually feel the difference afterward.\" Another user commented on the ease of use, saying, \"I recently had hand surgery, and this toothbrush basically does the work for me.\" Parents have also shared positive feedback about how their children respond to the design. One mother mentioned, \"My child actually wants to brush now. The soft bristles and playful design make the routine so much easier.\" A reviewer added that the brush is \"perfect for little teeth and reaches areas traditional brushes miss.\" These consistent observations highlight why both adults and children find the HEISR toothbrush engaging, comfortable, and effective in daily use. Strong Repeat Use Among U.S. Customers Across HEISR's U.S. user base, replacement brush heads remain among the most frequently reordered items. While brushing habits vary, internal sales patterns show that users continue relying on the 3-sided system long-term \u2014 suggesting the design is not a novelty but a sustainable upgrade to their routine. Designed for Modern Lifestyles \"The real barrier to effective brushing has never been motivation \u2014 it's reach,\" said a HEISR spokesperson. \"When a brush can cover all sides at once with ultra-soft bristles, you simplify the routine while improving results. People feel the difference not after weeks, but after days.\" Consumer insights reflect growing demand for oral-care tools that improve efficiency with minimal learning curves. HEISR believes its tri-surface design meets this shift by offering an easy, effective path to better daily habits. Black Friday: Up to 40% Off HEISR's Black Friday promotions are now available exclusively at www.heisr.com. The brand expects strong interest from both returning supporters and first-time users seeking a meaningful upgrade to their oral-care routine heading into the new year.

Third quarter (3Q25) results extended the recovery momentum established in the second quarter (2Q25), supported by higher effective working hours and shorter cycle times across key sites. While year-to date performance remained affected by the significant disruptions in 1Q25, quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) results continued to improve, demonstrating growing operational consistency. 3Q25: Recovery Strengthens Across Volumes, Productivity, and EarningsOperational performance continued to improve through 3Q25, following the recovery that began in 2Q. Overburden removal increased by 4% from 1Q to 2Q and by 25% from 2Q to 3Q, reflecting stronger operational conditions. Equipment working hours rose 29% from January to September, driven by higher equipment readiness and stronger utilization, while non-productive hours fell 53%, due to drier weather and faster post-rain recovery. Cycle times improved 12% following stronger operational planning that reduced dump-time and queuing delays, supported by bottlenecks fixes across disposal areas, haul roads, and geological material issues. These operational gains resulted in lower unit costs across multiple areas. Unit cash costs per BCM fell 28% from 1Q to 3Q. Manpower cost per BCM dropped 45% as stricter shift discipline reduced the operator-to-equipment ratio by 13% over the same period. Fuel cost per BCM declined 14% as fuel consumption dropped 10%, driven by the aforementioned cycle time improvement initiatives. Repair and maintenance cost per BCM decreased 13%, enabled by condition-based maintenance and better component planning, which increased average component life by 28%. In 3Q25, overburden reached 128 million bank cubic meter (MBCM) and coal production totalled 22 million tonnes (MT), up 18% and 12% QoQ, respectively. These improvements were supported by higher effective working hours and shorter cycle times, as the result of faster post-rain recovery, tighter shift execution, smoother haul roads, and bottleneck fixes across disposal areas. 3Q25 revenue increased to US$400 million, up 6% QoQ in line with higher production, while EBITDA rose to US$63 million (19% margin), compared with US$50 million (16% margin) in 2Q25. The net loss narrowed to US$1 million, supported by better EBITDA and fair value gains from the Group's investment in 29Metals. Iwan Fuad Salim, Director of BUMA International Group, stated, \"The third quarter shows that our recovery is becoming more firmly established. Higher effective working hours, shorter cycle times, and tighter cost control delivered better volumes, lower unit costs, and stronger EBITDA despite a still challenging backdrop. As we move into year-end, our focus remains on sustaining these improvement gains, protecting margins, and strengthening operational excellence across the business.\" 9M25 Results: Year-to-Date Performance Still Reflects 1Q ImpactDespite the stronger performance in 2Q and 3Q, year-to-date (YTD) results remain affected by the severe weather and unprecedented operational disruptions experienced during the 1Q25, including safety events involving external contractors that led to a 27-day suspension at two major sites. YTD performance was further shaped by planned ramp-downs at several Indonesian sites and the conclusion of contracts in Australia. Overburden reached 337 MBCM and coal production totalled 60 MT, down 20% and 8% year-on-year (YoY), respectively. Revenue stood at US$1.131 billion, 16% lower YoY mainly due to lower mining-contractor volumes following 1Q disruptions. ASP remained broadly stable at \u20131% YoY, supported by a higher share of rise-and-fall contracts that helped cushion weaker coal prices. Revenue from the mining-ownership business, Atlantic Carbon Group, Inc. (ACG), increased to US$45 million from US$12 million last year, reflecting its full-period contribution in 2025. 9M25 EBITDA was US$127 million, reflecting a 14% margin compared with 22% in 9M24. Excluding severance expenses, EBITDA would have been US$148 million with a 16% margin. The Group recorded a net loss of US$81 million, mainly due to lower EBITDA and receivable provisions in the Australian operations, partly offset by fair-value gains from 29Metals, lower interest expense, tax benefits, and favorable foreign-exchange movements. CAPEX reached US$149 million, up 12% year-on-year, with 54% allocated to sustain fleet reliability and readiness, and 46% directed toward growth to support ramp-ups at key Indonesian sites. Environmental and social performance improved during the period. Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity declined 17% QoQ, supported by road upgrades, better handling of geological material, and more favorable rainfall. The Group also expanded its social impact through PT BISA Ruang Vokasi (BIRU), reaching more beneficiaries through BIRU's Future Hub, where 30% of tracked graduates are now employed and 10% have continued to higher education. The Group also completed its Social Impact Theory of Change, establishing a unified framework to measure and scale long-term community impact across all operating regions. Balance Sheet Strengthened After the Reporting PeriodThe Group continued to apply a prudent and disciplined approach to liquidity management throughout the year. Consistent with its strategy to diversify funding sources and strengthen its maturity profile, the Group executed two key financing actions following the end of the nine-month period. In October, its principal subsidiary, PT Bukit Makmur Mandiri Utama (BUMA) issued US$53.7 million (Rp884 billion) of the BUMA III 2025 Bonds, broadening its domestic funding base and reinforcing investor confidence in the Group's credit profile. In November, the Group also completed the early retirement of US$212.25 million of the 7.75% Senior Notes, primarily funded through its syndicated facility. This action reduces near-term refinancing risk and enhances the Group's overall debt maturity profile.
