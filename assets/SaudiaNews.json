Malaysia\u2019s State of CX Research and Report 2025 to Be Launched at CX Summit 2025 This milestone launch marks a significant step forward in Malaysia's CX journey\u2014providing comprehensive data, insights, and direction to elevate customer experience as a key driver of national growth. Building on the success of the 2024 study, the 2025 edition continues Twimbit's well-recognized Exceptional CX Framework, featuring deeper analyses across industries and expanded evaluation criteria. Attendees of CX Summit 2025 will gain exclusive early access to the latest CX rankings, insights, and benchmarks that reveal how Malaysian brands are performing in an increasingly competitive and digital marketplace. A National Benchmark for Progress In 2024, the Contact Centre Association of Malaysia (CCAM), through its CX Malaysia chapter, entered a three-year collaboration with renowned research organization Twimbit to pioneer a first-of-its-kind national study assessing how organizations across Malaysia deliver customer experience. The State of CX in Malaysia framework was designed to be both comprehensive and actionable\u2014measuring over 60 parameters across four dimensions: Brand Experience, Service Experience, Employee Experience, and Digital Experience. The inaugural 2024 report revealed strong performance from sectors such as digital commerce, financial services, property development, and telecommunications, while industries like F&B, retail, healthcare, and the public sector showed significant room for growth. Malaysia's overall CX score of 3.61 reflected a solid foundation and signaled opportunities for further advancement. The 2025 report will build on this foundation\u2014examining whether Malaysia's CX maturity has progressed, identifying sectors setting new benchmarks, and exploring how digital-first organizations are leveraging innovation to deepen trust, loyalty, and customer lifetime value. Elevating Malaysia's CX Game and the Economy The State of CX in Malaysia Report serves not only as a measurement tool but as a strategic blueprint for national business and economic progress. \"The State of CX in Malaysia Report is more than a benchmark\u2014it's a roadmap,\" said Vigneswaran Sivalingam, President of CCAM and Chairperson of CX Malaysia. \"It gives organizations the data-driven insights they need to understand where they stand and how to improve. As Malaysia moves toward an experience-driven economy, CX will be the defining factor in competitiveness, innovation, and growth.\" By elevating CX capabilities across industries, organizations strengthen brand reputation, enhance customer loyalty, and contribute to greater national productivity and global competitiveness. A thriving CX ecosystem can fuel sustainable business growth\u2014driving innovation, talent development, and ultimately, Malaysia's economic expansion. Digitalisation and Trust: The Twin Pillars of Modern CX In today's hyperconnected environment, digitalisation is revolutionizing how businesses connect with and serve their customers. From AI-driven personalization and predictive analytics to omnichannel engagement and intelligent automation, technology is helping brands anticipate and respond to evolving customer needs with greater precision. Yet, technology alone cannot sustain loyalty. In an era where interactions are increasingly digital, trust has become the new business currency\u2014earned through transparency, consistency, and human empathy at every touchpoint. Organizations that strike the right balance between digital efficiency and emotional connection will define the next frontier of CX excellence. Be Part of the Movement The unveiling of the State of CX in Malaysia 2025 Report at CX Summit 2025 marks a pivotal moment in positioning Malaysia as a regional leader in customer experience excellence.

The study measured lower needle deformation and higher anti-tilt resistance under load, attributes that help keep the needle closer to perpendicular for more consistent subcutaneous delivery. These engineering findings are consistent with the product's human-factors design rationale. Sandstone EasydripTM Plus pen needle features the patented Hextra TechTM broad hub for improved stability and comfort. \"For people who inject daily, a pen needle that stays steady and feels gentle can reduce anxiety and support adherence,\" said a Sandstone spokesperson. \"Hextra TechTM was engineered to give users greater control at home and on the go.\" What sets EasydripTM Plus apart Hextra TechTM hub stabilization \u2014 Broad, six-facet platform that steadies the pen during insertion, helping reduce wobble and the risk of bending/breakage in self-injection. Controlled penetration path \u2014 Geometry tuned to support perpendicular entry and help avoid intramuscular delivery, reinforcing reliable at-home dosing. Enlarged inner & outer caps \u2014 Easy-grip, ergonomic caps designed for secure handling and single-hand re-capping while helping guard against accidental sticks. Smooth insertion \u2014 Thin-wall, polished multi-facet cannula with silicone lubrication supports gentle, low-force entry and dependable flow. Practical range \u2014 Single-use, sterilized; available in multiple gauges and lengths; compatible with widely used insulin pens. Why it matters Pen-needle stability and comfort directly influence user confidence and adherence. A hub that resists tilt can minimize off-target delivery and help make frequent self-injections feel more manageable\u2014outcomes EasydripTM Plus is designed to support.

This milestone celebrates a quarter-century of pioneering business education in Asia and sets the stage for the next chapter in global leadership. Twenty-five years ago, INSEAD made a bold decision to establish a second full-fledged campus, based in Singapore, making INSEAD the first global business school to adopt the dual-campus model that defines its global presence. Francisco Veloso, Dean of INSEAD, said, \"Much of the world's growth and transformation over the past decades has taken place in this region\u2013and its potential is still unfolding. At a time when the world is becoming increasingly fragmented, the need for dialogue and collaboration has never been greater. With strong foundations in Asia, INSEAD is well-positioned to lead critical conversations, prepare future leaders and shape the future of business education.\" Speakers and guests during the INSEAD Asia Campus 25th Anniversary Celebration on Friday, 31 October.

INSEAD in Asia and Singapore: 25 years of impact and innovation rooted in a four decades of legacy INSEAD's roots in Asia date back to 1980, when it founded the pioneering Euro-Asia Centre, which laid the crucial groundwork for understanding Asian business systems and fostering collaboration between Europe and Asia. In 2000, the Asia Campus was officially inaugurated by the late Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, founding father of modern Singapore, where it welcomed its first MBA cohort of 53 students. Since then, it has grown into a strategic hub for leadership development, innovation, and transformation. Each year, more than 1,300 students and 3,500 executives study on the Asia Campus. The INSEAD community in Asia now includes 13,000+ alumni, with 4,000+ in Singapore. INSEAD Alumni lead businesses globally, while the school's partnerships with governments, academia and industry continue to grow. The Asia Campus is also home to 55 faculty members from diverse disciplines, whose research and teaching continue to deepen the school's regional relevance. Through rigorous research and education, they equip leaders to navigate Asia's complexity and contribute to sustainable global growth. \"The success of our faculty and alumni, whose impact is felt across businesses and sectors in this region, is a strong testament to the school's vision set 25 years ago,\" said Sameer Hasija, Dean of Asia Campus and Dean of Executive Education, \"As we celebrate this milestone, we reflect on our journey, build on our momentum and chart the course for the next 25 years of excellence and innovation in education.\" Looking to the Future: Three core pillars The anniversary celebrations and the campus' vision for the future are anchored on three strategic pillars: A Launchpad for the Future of Business and Leadership \u2013 Leveraging its deep foundations in Asia, INSEAD shapes future-ready global leaders through transformative Degree Programmes, including MBA, MIM, MIF, TIEMBA and GEMBA Asia. The school's Executive Education portfolio, including over 60 Open Programmes and a wide range of Custom Programmes, further strengthens its commitment to developing leaders who can anticipate emerging trends and navigate strategic shifts across the region. A Strategic Hub for Academic Knowledge and Innovation \u2013 The Asia Campus serves both as a base for cutting-edge research in the region and a global access point to our recognised academic work, including Nobel-awarded pioneering research by Professor Philippe Aghion on sustainable growth through creative destruction. Beyond research, it continues to drive learning innovation, entrepreneurial excellence and digital transformation. A Lifelong Community of Learning, Networks and Engagement \u2013 INSEAD's greatest strength lies in its people. The Asia Campus fosters a strong sense of belonging through shared experiences and values. Alumni and student impact stories continue to inspire and connect the community across the region and the world. The anniversary week is featuring a series of events, including some in partnership with the Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology (SWITCH), connecting INSEAD with the city's vibrant innovation ecosystem. These include thought leadership forums, alumni reunions and celebrations that bring together students, faculty, alumni and partners from around the world. The celebrations will continue throughout this academic year with ongoing events and activities. Key events such as the annual launch of the Global Talent Competitiveness Index (GTCI), the Learning Summit and the INSEAD for Impact Programme will continue to reinforce the school's commitment to innovation, inclusivity and thought leadership, strengthening its regional impact and shaping a globally connected generation of leaders.
