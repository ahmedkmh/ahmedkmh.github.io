AMG M&M is promoted by the two founders of Greenko and AM Green. Together, the parties will consider the potential development of up to a 1 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) primary aluminium smelter and 2 Mtpa of alumina production, both powered by renewable wind and solar energy firmed by pumped hydro storage. The development will comprise a study to evaluate a potential first phase 500,000 tonnes per annum primary aluminium smelter in a favourable location in India. Rio Tinto Aluminium Chief Executive Je\u0301ro\u0302me Pe\u0301cresse said: \"This study is an important step in our ambition to grow our global, low-carbon aluminium footprint while exploring new project delivery approaches and opportunities in emerging markets. Partnering with AMG Metals & Materials enables us to assess how we can develop low-cost responsible aluminium production powered by renewable energy. With its rapid economic growth and strategic position, India is a compelling location for this potential project and aligns with our long-term vision for a globally more diverse and resilient aluminium business.\" As part of the study, AMG M&M will examine a firmed renewable energy solution with Greenko, while Rio Tinto will explore a commercial alumina solution. The study will also assess smelting technology options to determine the most cost-effective solution for the project. Group President of AMG Metals & Materials and Greenko Mahesh Kolli said: \"Over the last few years, we have been able to deliver a multitude of decarbonization solutions comprising electricity, molecules, chemicals and fuels. We are excited to expand that further to the materials space. This MOU could deliver much needed low-carbon metal at scale to propel decarbonization initiatives in global supply chains across auto, construction, consumer packaging and many more segments.\" About AMG Metals & Materials AMG Metals & Materials is incorporated by Anil Chalamalasetty and Mahesh Kolli, the founders of Greenko Group, one of India's leading energy transition solutions providers, and AM Green, a global decarbonization solution provider. Greenko has a near-term operational renewable energy capacity of 10 GW across solar, wind and hydro and is building 100 GWh of single cycle storage capacity across India. AM Green is developing low-carbon ammonia projects across multiple locations in India with a goal to reach 5 Mtpa of green ammonia capacity by 2030.
