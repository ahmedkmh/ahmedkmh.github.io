By the end of February, the installed capacity of new energy in the Wuzhong area reached 13.2916 million kilowatts, accounting for 63.59% of the total installed power supply capacity in the region, marking a significant breakthrough in new energy development. As the transition period between the conclusion of the \"14th Five-Year Plan\" and the commencement of the \"15th Five-Year Plan\" approaches, the company aims to optimize the new energy service system by strictly adhering to the timeframes outlined in the \"Grid Fair Supervision Measures.\" It has established expedited channels for grid connection applications and ensures that all preliminary project work complies with legal and regulatory requirements through proactive provision of access parameters and parallel audit design reports. In terms of power grid construction, the company coordinates the development of multi-level grids ranging from 35 kV to 750 kV. Leveraging the seven under-construction 750-kV substations in Xingtang and Weizhou, it plans to construct ten 330-kV transmission and transformation projects in Shuofang and Lide, while simultaneously promoting main transformer substation expansions to build a multi-level network for new energy consumption. To address the investment pressures faced by new energy enterprises, the company innovatively implemented a buyback mechanism for grid connection projects. By comprehensively sorting out asset ownership and establishing project list ledgers, pre-buyback agreements have been reached with several power generation enterprises. Standardized processes for due diligence and asset evaluation ensure that asset disposal remains lawful and compliant. Currently, the buyback work for grid connection projects is being carried out in an orderly manner, effectively activating enterprise funds. In the next phase, State Grid Wuzhong Power Supply Company will focus on enhancing the support capabilities of the power grid, accelerating the expansion of new energy consumption channels, deepening the application of new technologies such as grid-based energy storage, and continuously improving the safe operation level of the power grid. This will provide robust support for the healthy and orderly development of new energy in the Wuzhong region.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-03-28 08:28:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_priority": 1333464, "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/en_prnasisa.png", "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top"], "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "a9b0192081a125664348465af841db35", "title": "\u00ab\u0632\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0650\u0637\u0652\u0631\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0631\u064f\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0641\u064f\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064f\u062c\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0639\u0650\u064a\u00bb \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639 \u062e\u0637\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645", "link": "https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/3411368", "keywords": null, "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "\u064a\u0648\u0654\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0654\u064a\u0654\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u062c\u062f \u062e\u0637\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u062a\u062d\u062a \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646 : \"\u0632\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0629\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0650\u0637\u0652\u0631\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0631\u064f\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0641\u064f\u0644\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064f\u062c\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0639\u0650\u064a\u0650\u0651\"\u060c \u0648\u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u062d\u062f\u062f\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0632\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0654\u0648\u0642\u0627\u0641.\u0648\u0642\u0627\u0644\u062a \u0648\u0632\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0654\u0648\u0642\u0627\u0641: \u0627\u0655\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u062f\u0641 \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0637\u0628\u0629 \u0647\u0648: \u062a\u0648\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u063a\u062a\u0646\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0642\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0631\u0645\u0636\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u062f\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0643\u0627\u0629- \u0648\u062e\u0635\u0648\u0635\u064b\u0627 \u0632\u0643\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0637\u0631- \u0641\u064a \u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642...", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-03-28 08:26:19", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://mediaaws.almasryalyoum.com/news/small/2025/01/24/2590065_0.jpg", "source_id": "almasryalyoum", "source_priority": 3417, "source_name": "Al-masry Al-youm", "source_url": "https://www.almasryalyoum.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/almasryalyoum.jpg", "language": "arabic", "country": ["israel", "yemen", "iraq", "kuwait", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "libya", "jordan"], "category": ["top"], "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "03f179dd77813f49282c87449ba4c6cb", "title": "\u0643\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0630\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u063a\u0631\u0628", "link": "https://www.majalla.com/node/324928/%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%B0%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%A8", "keywords": null, "creator": ["layout"], "video_url": null, "description": "\u0643\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0630\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u063a\u0631\u0628layoutFri, 03/28/2025 -
