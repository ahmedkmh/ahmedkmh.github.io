Yet, due to underreporting, the true prevalence of these incidents remains obscured, jeopardizing patient safety and healthcare management. AESOP Technology, a medical AI startup, has developed an innovative solution: the Association Outlier Pattern (AOP) machine learning model. This model offers real-time decision support and retrospective analysis, aimed at enhancing surgical safety and care quality. According to the World Health Organization's (WHO) 2024 Patient Safety Report, a mere 38% of countries have established reporting systems for never events. In the United States, the Joint Commission documented 112 surgical errors in 2023, with wrong-site surgeries comprising 62% of these incidents. The absence of comprehensive reporting hinders the healthcare system's ability to gauge the issue's magnitude and implement effective preventative measures. Inconsistent documentation is one of the major contributors to WSS. To address this, AESOP utilized data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Limited Data Set (2017\u20132020), examining discrepancies in surgical laterality. This analysis informed the creation of the AOP model\u2014the first of its kind dedicated to addressing WSS. Unlike traditional rule-based systems that merely verify consistency, the AOP model analyzes intricate patterns between diagnoses and surgeries. It excels in handling incomplete or ambiguous diagnostic data, achieving an accuracy rate of over 80% in identifying surgical errors, outperforming existing methods. The AOP model empowers healthcare organizations to detect inconsistencies in medical records, identify unreported surgical errors, and enhance reporting mechanisms. This not only improves patient safety but also strengthens management systems for error prevention. Beyond retrospective analysis, the AOP model offers real-time decision support during surgical planning. It automatically flags incorrect associations between surgical codes and diagnoses, ensuring accurate and complete records. This real-time capability reduces error risks, making the AOP model an essential tool for future electronic health record (EHR) systems. \"We are thrilled with the preliminary outcomes of our research and look forward to integrating these insights into DxPrime's patient safety features this year,\" said Jim Long, CEO of AESOP Technology. \"Our advancements in automating surgery coding show great potential for helping physicians deliver safer care, reduce documentation time, and enable medical coders to perform better concurrent surgery coding and review when patients are still hospitalized.\" Having demonstrated its efficacy in orthopedics, the AOP model holds promise for other specialties reliant on laterality, such as ophthalmology and otolaryngology. This expansion aligns with AESOP's commitment to advancing patient-centered AI solutions across diagnostics, medication safety, and now surgical safety\u2014ushering in a new era of reliable and safer healthcare. About AESOP Technology AESOP Technology harnesses the power of AI to revolutionize clinical decision-making through its Clinical Diagnostic Reasoning Network model. By enhancing the accuracy of diagnoses, medication prescriptions, and medical coding, AESOP aims to improve patient safety and streamline healthcare processes. Its innovative solutions seamlessly integrate with EHR systems to boost efficiency and minimize errors, setting a new standard in medical care.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-02-18 16:30:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_priority": 1333464, "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/en_prnasisa.png", "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top"], "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": true}, {"article_id": "7214fbd12946afeea055d6cbefdf3da9", "title": "Germany\u2019s Power Prices Dip as Natural Gas Falls amid Ukraine Talks", "link": "https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Germanys-Power-Prices-Dip-as-Natural-Gas-Falls-amid-Ukraine-Talks.html", "keywords": null, "creator": ["Charles Kennedy"], "video_url": null, "description": "Germany\u2019s year-ahead power futures prices fell this week to the lowest level since the beginning of the year amid falling European natural gas prices as talks on a peace deal in Ukraine began.

This significant change comes as part of Thailand's ongoing efforts to modernize healthcare services and enhance patient care through digital transformation. BNH Hospital building BNH Hospital, Thailand's first international private hospital, was founded in 1898. It was acquired by Bangkok Dusit Medical Services (BDMS), the largest private hospital group in Thailand, and is now part of the Samitivej group, includes six other hospitals. By adopting the TrakCare EMR system, Samitivej aims to enhance operational efficiency and facilitate the integration of new technologies, such as advanced data analytics, crucial for clinical decision-making. Three Samitivej hospitals have used InterSystems TrakCare for nearly a decade, while four others previously used different EMR systems, complicating standardization for effective data analytics. InterSystems collaborated with Samitivej to implement TrakCare across the group, completing the last of the four new installations in April. The transition to a new system at BNH Hospital, which had a heavily customized previous system, created opportunities for improvement. To ensure clinician adoption, InterSystems partnered with BNH Hospital on a change management program. The program, led by surgeon and BNH Assistant Hospital Director Dr. Apichai Chaiyaroj, Dr. Natthinee Mattanapojanat, and Ms. Sareeyanan Sasiyabhand, received strong support from hospital executives and engaged clinicians from the start of the TrakCare implementation. BNH Hospital achieved 100% clinician adoption of TrakCare since its initial implementation in February, surpassing the previous EMR system's 70% adoption rate. With full adoption, BNH Hospital now enjoys improved access to clinical, operational, and financial data, providing a comprehensive view of patient information. Using the latest version of TrakCare without customizations facilitates future technology innovations and ensures compliance with Thailand's regulatory requirements. BNH Hospital's leadership plans to involve clinicians in exploring additional TrakCare functionalities. Dr. Chaiyaroj emphasized their commitment to a fully paperless environment for inpatients and outpatients, focusing on creating a user-friendly system for doctors. He noted that collaboration with InterSystems has been vital, stating, \"We've streamlined data entry into TrakCare and will leverage it fully, avoiding unnecessary add-ons.\" Regarding future plans, Dr. Chaiyaroj expressed excitement about engaging clinicians with more TrakCare features. \"We're looking forward to expanding closed-loop medication management, which we've successfully piloted, as well as diving into data analytics. We're also integrating mobile devices, allowing for even greater accessibility for our doctors.\" Luciano Brustia, InterSystems Regional Managing Director, Asia Pacific, remarked, \"Our collaboration with BNH Hospital on this change management process has been rewarding. The leadership of Dr. Chaiyaroj and his team has been crucial in ensuring a smooth transition and achieving 100% clinician engagement, a significant milestone for leveraging new technology to enhance patient care.\"", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-02-18 16:28:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url":
