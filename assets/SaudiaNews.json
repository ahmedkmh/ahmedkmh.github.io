Item 13 \u2013 Election of Board of Directors and Chair of the Board The Nomination Committee proposes that the following persons are elected to the Board of Directors until the end of the Annual General Meeting 2026.

A presentation of the proposed Directors of the Board is available on Electrolux Group's website, www.electroluxgroup.com/agm2025. Item 14 \u2013 Election of Auditor The Nomination Committee proposes, in accordance with the recommendation by the Audit Committee, election of the audit firm O\u0308hrlings PricewaterhouseCoopers AB as the Company's auditor for the period until the end of the Annual General Meeting 2026. Item 16 \u2013 Resolutions on a) transfer of own shares on account of company acquisitions; and b) transfer of own shares on account of the share program for 2023 The Company has previously, on the basis of authorizations by the Annual General Meeting, acquired own shares for the purpose of using these shares to finance potential company acquisitions, as a hedge for the Company's share related incentive programs as well as to adapt the Company's capital structure. The Board of Directors considers it to be of continued advantage for the Company to be able to use repurchased shares on account of potential company acquisitions and the Company's share related incentive programs, and the Board of Directors therefore proposes the authorization to be renewed for the period until the following Annual General Meeting. In view of the above, the Board of Directors proposes as follows. a) Transfer of own shares on account of company acquisitions The Board of Directors proposes the Annual General Meeting to authorize the Board of Directors, for the period until the next Annual General Meeting, on one or several occasions, to resolve on transfers of the Company's own shares of series B in connection with or as a consequence of company acquisitions as follows. Own shares of series B held by the Company at the time of the Board of Directors' decision on the transfer may be transferred. Transfer of shares may take place outside Nasdaq Stockholm as set out in Chapter 19, Sections 35\u201337 of the Swedish Companies Act. The shares may be transferred with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be that transfer of own shares enables alternative forms of payment for company acquisitions which according to the Board of Directors is beneficial for the Company and contributes to increased shareholder value. Transfer of shares shall be made at a minimum price per share corresponding to an amount in close connection with the price of the Company's share of series B on Nasdaq Stockholm at the time of the decision on the transfer. Payment for transferred shares may be made in cash, by contributions in kind or by a set-off of Company debt. b) Transfer of own shares on account of the share program for 2023 The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the Company shall be entitled, for the period until the next Annual General Meeting, on one or several occasions, to transfer a maximum of 815,000 own shares of series B in the Company for the purpose of covering costs related to social security charges, that may arise as a result of the Company's obligations under the previously adopted share program for 2023. Such transfers shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the prevailing price interval for the Company's shares of series B at Nasdaq Stockholm from time to time. Majority requirement Valid resolutions in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposals a) and b) above require that shareholders holding no less than two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting are in favor of the proposals. Item 17 \u2013 Resolutions on a) implementation of a performance based long-term share program for 2025, and hedging arrangements by either b) transferring own shares to the participants in the long-term share program for 2025 or c) entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party Background The Board of Directors in the Company has decided to propose a performance based long-term incentive program for 2025 (the \"Share Program 2025\"). The proposed program is in all material aspects unchanged compared with the share program for 2024, with the exception that a one-year performance period shall be applied with respect to the financial performance target ('earnings per share') whilst the three-year performance period shall remain for the other performance target ('CO2 reduction'). The Board of Directors is convinced that the proposed program will be beneficial to the Company's shareholders as it will contribute to the possibilities to recruit and retain competent employees in Electrolux Group, is expected to increase the commitment and the motivation of the program participants and strengthen the participants' ties to the Company and its shareholders. Proposals of the Board of Directors In view of the above, the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves a) to implement the Share Program 2025, and hedging arrangements by either b) transferring own shares to the participants in the Share Program 2025 or c) entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party. a) Resolution on implementation of a performance based long-term share program for 2025 The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement the Share Program 2025 with the following principal terms and conditions: The program is proposed to include up to 800 senior managers and key employees of Electrolux Group, who are divided into seven participant groups; the President and CEO (\"Group 1\"), other members of Group Management (\"Group 2\"), and five additional groups for other senior managers and key employees (\"Group 3\u20137\"). Invitation to participate in the program shall be provided by the Company no later than on May 16, 2025. Participants are offered to be allocated shares of series B in the Company (\"Performance Shares\"), provided that the participant remains employed until January 1, 2028. Exemptions to this requirement may be prescribed in specific cases, including a participant's death, disability, retirement or the divestiture through a sale, spin-off or otherwise of the participant's employing company from Electrolux Group. The Performance Shares shall be based on maximum performance values for each participant group. The maximum performance value for the participants in Group 1 will be 100 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2025, for participants in Group 2, 90 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2025, for participants in Group 3, 80 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2025, for participants in Group 4, 60 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2025, for participants in Group 5, 50 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2025, for participants in Group 6, 40 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2025, and for participants in Group 7, 20 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2025. The total sum of the maximum values of the Performance Shares defined for all participants will not exceed MSEK 541 excluding social costs. Each maximum performance value shall thereafter be converted into a maximum number of Performance Shares[1], based on the average closing price paid for the Company's share of series B on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of ten trading days before the day the participants are invited to participate in the Share Program 2025, reduced by the present value of estimated dividend payments for the period until shares are allotted. The calculation of the number of Performance Shares shall be connected to performance targets established by the Board of Directors for the performance period, for Electrolux Group's (i) earnings per share[2] and (ii) CO2 reduction[3]. The performance targets adopted by the Board of Directors will stipulate a minimum level and a maximum level, with the relative weight of the performance targets (i) and (ii) being 80 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively. For the participants in Group 1 and 2 (Group Management), the granted Performance Shares based on (i) and (ii) will be multiplied by 0.75\u20131.25 depending on the outcome of a relative total shareholder return target[4]. The performance period is one year (financial year 2025) with respect to performance target (i) earnings per share and three years (financial years 2025\u20132027) with respect to performance target (ii) CO2 reduction as well as three years (financial years 2025\u20132027) with respect to the relative total shareholder return target for the participants in Group 1 and 2 (Group Management). Performance outcome of the established performance targets will be determined by the Board of Directors after the expiry of the respective performance period. If the maximum performance level is reached or exceeded, the allocation will amount to (and will not exceed) the maximum number of Performance Shares following from 3 and 4 above. If performance is below the maximum level but exceeds the minimum level, a proportionate allocation of Performance Shares will be made. No allocation will be made if performance amounts to or is below the minimum level. Information on the performance targets and the outcome will be provided no later than in connection with the allocation of Performance Shares in accordance with 7 below. If all conditions in the Share Program 2025 are met, allocation of Performance Shares will take place in the first half of 2028. Allocation will be free of consideration except for tax liabilities. Certain deviations in or adjustments of the terms and conditions for the Share Program 2025 may be made based on local rules and regulations as well as applicable market practice or market conditions or, where appropriate, due to group re-organizations, including cash settlement instead of delivery of shares under certain circumstances. The Board of Directors, or a committee established by the Board for these purposes, shall be responsible for the preparation and management of the Share Program 2025, within the framework of the aforementioned terms and conditions. If material changes would occur within Electrolux Group or on the market that, according to the Board of Directors' assessment, would lead to the conditions for allocation of Performance Shares no longer being reasonable, the Board of Directors shall also have the right to make other adjustments of the Share Program 2025, including e.g. a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of Performance Shares. Costs for the Share Program 2025 The total costs for the Share Program 2025, if the maximum number of Performance Shares are delivered, are estimated to a maximum of MSEK 629, which corresponds to approximately 2.61 per cent of Electrolux Group's total employment cost for 2024. The costs will be recognized over the years 2025\u20132027, in accordance with IFRS 2. The costs have been calculated as the sum of salary costs, including social costs, and administration costs for the program. Administration costs are estimated to be less than MSEK 1. If no allotment of shares is made, only administration costs will arise. The costs have been calculated based on the value, at the start of the program, of the Performance Shares that may be allotted at maximum performance, through transfer of own shares, with a reduction of the present value of estimated dividend payments during a three-year period. The estimate on maximum costs assumes maximum performance and that the number of participants that will leave Electrolux Group during the performance period is the same as the historical average since the introduction of share programs in 2004. In the calculation, a maximum share price of SEK 183 per share has been applied. Hedging measures for the Share Program 2025 In order to implement the Share Program 2025 in a cost-effective and flexible manner, the Board of Directors has considered various methods for transfer of shares to the participants. The Board of Directors has found that the most cost-effective alternative is transfer of own shares and proposes as the main alternative that the Annual General Meeting resolves on transfer of own shares in accordance with item b) below. Should the majority required under item b) below not be reached, the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the Company should be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item c) below. The costs in connection with an equity swap agreement will be higher than the costs in connection with the transfer of own shares. Number of shares, effects on key figures, etc. The maximum number of Performance Shares that could be allotted to the participants under the Share Program 2025 shall be limited to 6,518,000, which corresponds to approximately 2.30 per cent of the total number of shares and 1.83 per cent of the votes in the Company.[5] The Share Program 2025 does not result in any dilutive effect on share capital or votes. If repurchased own shares are allocated under the Share Program 2025, the number of outstanding shares in the Company will increase with not more than 6,518,000 shares of series B, which corresponds to a maximum dilutive effect on earnings per share of approximately 2.36 per cent.[6] The dilutive effect on earnings per share is independent of the share price as Performance Shares are delivered free of consideration. The total maximum increase in the number of outstanding shares of all outstanding share programs in the Company is estimated to be not more than 16,591,000 shares of series B, delivered free of consideration, corresponding to a dilutive effect on earnings per share of approximately 5.80 per cent.[7] In this calculation, the maximum allotment of shares has been assumed for the share programs 2025, 2024 and 2023. b) Resolution on transfers of own shares to the participants in the long-term share program for 2025 In order to secure the delivery of Performance Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Share Program 2025, the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the Company shall transfer a maximum of 6,518,000 shares of series B in the Company on the following terms and conditions: The right to receive shares shall be granted to participants within Electrolux Group covered by the terms and conditions pursuant to the Share Program 2025. Furthermore, subsidiaries within Electrolux Group shall have the right to acquire shares, free of consideration, and such subsidiaries shall be obligated to immediately transfer, free of consideration, shares to participants covered by the terms and conditions of the Share Program 2025. The participant shall have the right to receive shares during the period when the participant is entitled to receive shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Share Program 2025. Participants covered by the terms and conditions of the Share Program 2025 shall receive shares of series B in the Company free of consideration. The number of shares of series B in the Company that may be transferred under the Share Program 2025 will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues, splits, rights issues and/or other similar corporate events. c) Resolution on entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party In the event that the required majority under item b) above cannot be reached, the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the expected financial exposure of the Share Program 2025 shall be hedged by the Company entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms and conditions in accordance with market practice, whereby the third party in its own name may acquire and transfer shares of series B in the Company to employees who participate in the Share Program 2025. Indicative costs for an equity swap agreement amount to approximately MSEK 45. Conditions The Annual General Meeting's resolution to implement the Share Program 2025 in accordance with item a) above is conditional upon the Annual General Meeting resolving either in accordance with the proposal to transfer own shares of series B in the Company to participants in the Share Program 2025 in accordance with item b) above, or that an equity swap agreement with a third party may be entered into by the Company in accordance with item c) above. Majority requirements The resolution of the Annual General Meeting to implement the Share Program 2025 according to item a) above requires that more than half of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting are in favor of the proposal. The resolution of the Annual General Meeting to transfer own shares according to item b) above requires that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting are in favor of the proposal. The resolution of the Annual General Meeting that the Company may enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item c) above requires that more than half of the votes cast are in favor of the proposal. Preparation of the proposal for the Share Program 2025 The proposal for the Share Program 2025 has been prepared by the People Committee and the Board of Directors. Other share related incentive programs For a description of the Company's outstanding share related incentive programs, reference is made to the Annual Report for 2024, note 27, and the corporate governance section on Electrolux Group's website, www.electroluxgroup.com/en/. In addition to the programs described, no other share related incentive programs have been implemented.
