In-Vehicle Infotainment system Displayed at CES 2025 This achievement is particularly meaningful as it demonstrates that the company has secured objective quality reliability by adopting international-standard software development processes from the early development stages, even in an environment that requires rigorous evaluation and verification. In particular, fully covering the design, evaluation, and validation domains within the V-cycle ranging from CL2 SYS 1\u20135 to SWE 1\u20136 is the first domestic case in Korea. ASPICE CL2 is an international certification that validates the systematic and consistent execution of the entire software development lifecycle, including development planning, requirements management, design validation, testing, and verification. It has become an essential qualification when collaborating with global OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers. With this certification, Beyless has met all ASPICE assessment criteria across 15 process areas, including MAN, SYS, SWE, and SUP. This confirms that the company has established a structured and repeatable software development process that goes beyond simple feature implementation. Notably, the CL2 assessment was conducted not through traditional document-based reviews, but through an infrastructure integrated with an Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) system. This validates that Beyless has secured a repeatable and sustainable quality management framework and has reached a level capable of meeting the quality demands of global OEMs. Hyung-Jun Kim, CEO of Beyless, stated, \"This certification is an important milestone that demonstrates our capabilities as a global leader in mobility software. Through this achievement, we will further enhance the quality and reliability of our infotainment systems and expand collaboration with global OEMs and Tier-1 partners.\" He added, \"The ASPICE CL2 certification showcases Beyless's commitment to quality innovation and compliance with international standards. Moving forward, we will pursue mass-production-level certifications and higher capability levels, including CL3 and beyond, to further strengthen our competitiveness in the global market.\"", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["aut", "cpr", "stw", "trn"], "creator": null, "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["technology", "top"], "datatype": "news", "pubDate": "2025-11-27 01:00:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://mma.prnasia.com/media2/2832501/ASPICE.jpg?p=medium600", "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 4111305, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/en_prnasisa.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": true}, {"article_id": "f13d27c580dafb9be13e9e1cccfb1171", "link": "https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Cutting-Edge-Space-Tech-Uncovers-Major-Lithium-Target-in-Quebec.html", "title": "Cutting-Edge Space Tech Uncovers Major Lithium Target in Quebec", "description": "Australian space company Fleet Space has used a satellite-enabled exploration platform to uncover a large lithium deposit in Quebec, demonstrating how these space vehicles can be used to expedite and streamline the mineral exploration process.

The funding will enable the evaluation of an innovative U-VLP\u00ae vaccine candidate, LYB014, which targets multiple stages of the most deadly form of malaria parasite's life cycle; as well as a new, low cost, highly pure adjuvant manufactured from synthetic components. Malaria remains one of the world's most devastating infectious diseases, with an estimated 263 million cases and nearly 600,000 deaths in 2023, primarily among children under five. While recent progress with first-generation vaccines is encouraging, there is a critical need for more affordable, effective, and broadly protective solutions. Patronus Biotech's has developed a world first malaria vaccine simultaneously targeting all three critical stages of the P. falciparum life cycle, showing promising opportunity to provide more effective and broad protection. The vaccine is combined with a low-cost adjuvant system designed to elicit a powerful and sustained immune response. This adjuvant, named A02, is engineered to enhance both humoral and cellular immunity, which is crucial for protection and preventing severe disease. \"Our scientific approach has the potential to transform the fight against malaria,\" said Dr. Jin, Chief Executive Officer of Patronus Biotech. \"Our goal with LYB014 and the A02 adjuvant is not just to prevent infection, but to create a more robust and affordable shield that can combat the parasite's complex biology.
