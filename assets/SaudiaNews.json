We are confident that these actions will fuel stronger performance going forward.\" Mr. Huang concluded. First Half 2025 Financial Results Revenues Total revenues increased by 2.71% to RMB15.33 million (US$2.14 million) for the first half of 2025 from RMB14.92 million for the same period of 2024. The increase was mainly attributed to increases of RMB0.38 million and RMB0.10 million in revenues from technical service fees and installment service fees, respectively, offset by the decrease of RMB0.07 million in revenue from wealth management service fees and others. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues decreased by 0.50% to RMB5.99 million (US$0.84 million) for the first half of 2025 from RMB6.02 million for the same period of 2024. This decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease of RMB1.18 million in origination and servicing cost, offset by the increase of RMB0.38 million in provision of credit losses and the decrease of RMB0.77 million in recovery of guarantee. Gross Profit Gross profit increased to RMB9.34 million (US$1.30 million) for the first half of 2025 from RMB8.90 million for the same period of 2024. Gross margin was 60.92% for the first half of 2025, compared to 59.66% for the same period of 202, reflecting a stable gross profit performance across periods. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses increased by 0.25% to RMB16.55 million (US$2.31 million) for the first half of 2025 from RMB16.51 million for the same period of 2024. The Company has been continuously optimizing and refining its organizational structure, marketing strategies and product matrix. Sales and marketing expenses for the first half of 2025 decreased by 4.54% to RMB8.15 million (US$1.14 million) from RMB8.54 million for the same period of 2024. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in marketing consulting expenditures. General and administrative expenses for the first half of 2025 increased by 5.68% to RMB6.03 million (US$0.84 million) from RMB5.71 million for the same period of 2024. This increase was primarily due to the increase in professional service fees. Research and development expenses for the first half of 2025 increased by 4.64% to RMB2.37 million (US$0.33 million) from RMB2.26 million for the same period of 2024. The slight increase was primarily due to the increase in salary and welfare for research and development department. Loss from operations Loss from operations decreased by 5.17% to RMB7.21 million (US$1.01 million) for the first half of 2025 from RMB7.61 million for the same period of 2024. Income tax (expense)/benefit The Company recorded income tax benefit of RMB1.82 million (US$0.25 million) for the first half of 2025, compared to income tax expense of RMB0.46 million incurred for the first half of 2024. Net loss As a result of the foregoing, net loss was RMB4.73 million (US$0.66 million) for the first half of 2025, compared to RMB8.34 million for the same period of 2024. Net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB4.88 million (US$0.68 million) for the first half of 2025, compared to net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB8.43 million for the same period of 2024. Adjusted net loss was RMB6.84 million (US$0.96 million) for the first half of 2025, compared to RMB8.34 million for the same period of 2024. Net Loss Per Share Basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share for the first half of 2025 were both RMB0.01 (US$0.00). Basic and diluted net loss per American Depositary Share (\"ADS\") for the first half of 2025 were both RMB0.31 (US$0.04). Each ADS represents thirty-five of the Company's Class A ordinary shares. Adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share for the first half of 2025 were both RMB0.01 (US$0.00). Adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS for the first half of 2025 were both RMB0.44 (US$0.06). Balance Sheet The Company has an aggregate of cash and cash equivalents and long-term restricted cash of RMB38.90 million (US$5.43 million) as of June 30, 2025, compared to RMB31.95 million as of December 31, 2024. Going Concern The Company acknowledged that there were recurring losses from operation since 2019. For the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company reported a net loss of RMB4.73 million (US$0.66 million). In addition, as of June 30, 2025, the Company reported a negative working capital of RMB403.79 million (US$56.37 million) and had an accumulated deficit of RMB2,533.38 million (US$353.65 million). The Company's operating results in future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties, and it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to reduce or eliminate its net loss in the foreseeable future. To alleviate pressure on capital turnover, the Company has entered into an agreement with a third-party institution to obtain a line of credit facility of up to US$40 million, with annual interest rate of 7% when drawn. Due to the uncertainty of future capital markets and the industry in which we operate, there is no assurance that the Company will achieve its budget goals, that future capital raising will be sufficient to support the Company's ongoing operations, or that any additional financing will be available in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to raise sufficient financing or the occurrence of events or circumstances that prevent the Company from meeting its budget goals, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and ability to achieve its intended business objectives. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Such realization and satisfaction are dependent, among other things, on the Company's ability to operate profitably, generate cash flows from operations, and secure financing arrangements to support its working capital requirements. Related party transaction A shareholder who also serves as a board member of the Company transferred its equity interests in Jimu Group to a third party and resigned from its key position at Jimu Group. In January 2025, the Company noted and verified this change and further assessed whether any other directors and key management personnel of the Company were related parties of Jimu Group, noting none. Accordingly, the Company concluded that Jimu Group ceased to be a related party of the Company as of January 1, 2025. Subsequent event On September 3, 2025, the Company entered into a share transfer agreement with ZIITECH PTY LTD (\"ZIITECH\") and certain shareholders of ZIITECH (\"Transferors\"). Under the share transfer agreement, the Transferors agreed to transfer an aggregate of 715,521 ordinary shares of ZIITECH, representing approximately 25% equity interest in ZIITECH, to the Company, in exchange for an aggregate of 83,726,789 Class A ordinary shares of the Company. On the same day, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement with each Transferor, under which the Company agreed to sell and issue an aggregate of 83,726,789 Class A ordinary shares to such Transferors or the persons designated by the Transferors. The transactions were completed as of the issuance of the earning release for the six months ended June 30, 2025. Under the shareholders' agreement, the Company is entitled to appoint two-thirds of the directors of ZIITECH, and most significant financial and operating activities are solely decided by the board, as such the two directors representing the Company can control ZIITECH's operation through the board. Upon completion of the transactions, the Company consolidates ZIITECH's financial statements pursuant to agreements with shareholders of ZIITECH. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In evaluating its business, the Company considers and uses adjusted net income/loss as a supplemental measure to review and assess its operating performance. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company defines adjusted net income/loss as net income/loss excluding share-based compensation expenses and income tax benefit recognized due to reversal of uncertain tax position. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure can help management evaluate the Company's operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net income/loss enables management to assess operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses and income tax benefit recognized due to reversal of uncertain tax position. The Company also believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by management in their financial and operational decision-making. This non-GAAP financial measure is not defined under U.S. GAAP and is not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using adjusted net income/loss is that it does not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect the Company's operations. The Company will continue to incur share-based compensation expenses in its business, which are reflected in the presentation of its adjusted net income/loss. Further, this non-GAAP financial measure may differ from non-GAAP financial information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore its comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income/loss, which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
