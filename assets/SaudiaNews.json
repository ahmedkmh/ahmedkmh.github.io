Neolix plans to use the funds to further invest in algorithm and technology R&D, develop new products for diverse commercial scenarios, enhance its service network and user experience, and fuel its global expansion plans. Neolix's Founder and CEO, Enyuan Yu, stated that the Series D fundraising will strengthen Neolix's technological and market leadership in autonomous intra-city logistics, accelerating large-scale commercial deployment to meet growing domestic and international demand. \"We believe autonomous delivery is a key part of future urban logistics. Neolix will continue building a robust fleet, advancing visual algorithms and dispatch engines to deliver safe and efficient autonomous solutions. Our goal is to empower urban logistics with autonomous driving, making RoboVans a new productivity tool and driving digital transformation in the industry.\" Leading the RoboVan Industry Into Large-Scale Deployment Founded by Mr. Enyuan Yu, Neolix has rapidly emerged as a global leader in autonomous delivery vehicles since its launch in 2018. The company has delivered over 10,000 L4 RoboVans, more than any other firm worldwide, and achieved a record-breaking 2,000 vehicle deliveries in a single month. Its vehicles are now deployed in over 300 cities in China, with Qingdao hosting more than 1,200 units. Neolix's popular X3 and X6 models have each surpassed 4,000 deliveries, demonstrating strong market demand. On the technology front, Neolix continues to pioneer breakthroughs. Its proprietary \"Neolix-VA\" vision-action foundation model marks the first large-scale deployment of an end-to-end model in the logistics sector, enabling RoboVans to navigate complex traffic environments through superior spatial intelligence and behavioral reasoning. Neolix is also the first company to deploy map-free autonomous driving in freight industry , enabling true point-to-point delivery on public roads with full environmental generalization. Its AI-powered Dispatch Center integrates real-time data on vehicles, routes, and orders to optimize fleet performance. Collectively, Neolix's L4 autonomous vehicles have accumulated over 50 million kilometers of real-world L4 driving, keeping the company far ahead of peers. Expanding Market Share and Commercial Scenarios Since obtaining China's first autonomous delivery license in 2021, Neolix has experienced explosive growth. Vehicle deliveries have increased more than tenfold annually for two consecutive years. Today, the company holds over 60% of cumulative market share, 70% of new monthly shipments, and 80% of monthly revenue in China's autonomous delivery vehicle segment, serving more than 300,000 clients ranging from large enterprises to small businesses. In the express delivery sector, Neolix commands a leading position as the only RoboVan supplier serving all major logistics players in China, including SF Express, JD Logistics, China Post, STO, YTO, ZTO, and J&T Express, capturing nearly 70% of key account tenders. Beyond express logistics, Neolix is rapidly expanding into fresh food, cold chain, supermarket, and urban freight scenarios, driving operational efficiency and service reliability, particularly during nighttime operations, where a single RoboVan can complete over 10 delivery cycles per shift. Earlier this year, Neolix and Didi Freight jointly launched the world's first RoboVan-as-a-Service (RaaS) model for on-demand logistics, significantly lowering the barrier to autonomous delivery adoption. Orders from these diversified urban logistics scenarios now account for more than half of Neolix's monthly order volume. In the broader urban logistics segment, Neolix currently serves hundreds of top-tier clients and commands over 60% market share. Accelerating Global Expansion Neolix's success extends beyond China. In October 2025, Neolix partnered with K2 Group, an Abu Dhabi\u2013based AI technology firm, to secure the first RoboVan license ever issued in the UAE, paving the way for scaled deployment across the Middle East. The company also joined Japan's largest autonomous driving association, Autoware, in September 2025, and in July 2025, signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the Incheon Metropolitan Government to promote RoboVan deployment in South Korea. Industry Outlook: 2025, the Breakout Year for Autonomous Delivery Analysts anticipate exponential growth in autonomous delivery vehicles over the next three years. Soochow Securities forecasts that more than 30,000 units will be sold in China in 2025 alone. Neolix estimates that China's urban logistics market, currently served by about 30 million delivery vehicles valued at over RMB 3 trillion, is poised for large-scale automation. Within three years, major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou could each see thousands of autonomous vehicles operating daily. Once fleets reach a certain level, Neolix envisions an intelligent logistics network serving both enterprises and individuals, enabling shared capacity and highly efficient resource allocation.

the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA) and Shanghai International Automobile City (SIAC) co-hosted the \"C-V2X Implementation in China and International Cooperation\" Conference. The full-day event brought together global experts for high-level strategic discussions and live demonstrations, highlighting China's rapid progress in C-V2X innovation while fostering dialogue across the international connected mobility ecosystem and showcasing the capabilities powered by 5G-Advanced (5G-A) \"The Shanghai conference and demonstrations highlighted China's proactive role in advancing C-V2X technologies. It is particularly significant as it showcases leadership and innovation that drive progress across the entire global ecosystem,\" said 5GAA Director General Christof Schmidt. Attendees witnessed live demonstrations of cutting-edge C-V2X technologies. China IMT-2020(5G)Promotion Group C-V2X Working Group and SIAC presented the \"Four Layers Demonstrations\", which included scenarios such as sudden cut-outs by preceding vehicles, work-zone alerts, and connected-assisted driving. These tests highlighted how advanced onboard units can receive real-time data from multiple vehicles ahead, enabling rapid adjustments and improving safety. Additionally, demonstrations also showcased how C-V2X enhances vehicle awareness under challenging weather conditions. In parallel, SIAC, AUMOVIO and China Unicom showcased C-V2X vehicle networking applications based on 5G-A network. Leveraging the 5G-A network, cross-operator real-time sensor information sharing between vehicles and on-demand information distribution between vehicles and infrastructure are achieved. The system supports typical application scenarios such as front-object detection, blind spot communication, and emergency collaboration. With end-to-end latency below 30ms, it meets the stringent low latency and high reliability requirements of C-V2X applications. \"We are honoured to co-host this international forum with 5GAA,\" said Gang Chen, Chairman of Shanghai International Automobile City. \"As China's first national pilot zone for intelligent and connected vehicles, SIAC is actively contributing China's practical experience and fostering global industrial synergy through our deep involvement in prestigious international organisations such as 5GAA and VDA. We are committed to building an open, integrated, and globally influential industrial ecosystem, accelerating the alignment and mutual recognition of Chinese solutions with international standards, and sharing 'China's Wisdom' and the 'Shanghai Model' with the world. We look forward to joining hands with global partners in pioneering a new chapter for intelligent and connected mobility,\" he said.
