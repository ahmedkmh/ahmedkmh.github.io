From left to right: Jason Mann, CEO of Genesis Fertilizers; Tamara Mawhinney, Canadian Ambassador to Korea; and Sangmin Lee, CEO of CARBONCO, at the Signing Ceremony held at the Canadian Embassy to Korea on November 20. The proposed facility will capture approximately 800,000 tons of CO2 annually, eliminating 95% of the carbon emissions generated by the plant. Captured CO2 will be delivered via pipeline in a compressed and dehydrated form to a storage hub located 10 miles from the facility for permanent sequestration. Genesis Fertilizers' production complex is set to be constructed in Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan, Canada, and is targeted to commence its commercial operations by 2029. The License Agreement signing ceremony was held in Schofield Hall at the Embassy of Canada to Korea on November 20, 2024, at 14:00 (UTC+9). The ceremony marked the commitment of both parties to collaborate on developing the world's lowest carbon foot-print nitrogen facility, utilizing cutting-edge amine-based carbon capture technology.

Cellid has developed the reference design spectacle-type AR smart glasses for global enterprises, which allows them to experience the most advanced technologies for smart glasses, such as the state-of-the-art, optical, see-through display method Waveguide (DOE method) and micro projector, which are being developed in-house. The reference design also includes the provision of an SDK to support the development of AR glasses applications linked to generative AI and object recognition functions. In conjunction with the launch of reference design, the business development partner and OEM partner programs will be launched to recruit partners aiming to promote digital transformation and create new businesses using AR glasses, as well as companies aiming to develop AR glasses as their own brand. The Waveguide (display lens for AR glasses) developed by Cellid, which is used in the reference model, achieves vivid full-color expression while remaining as thin and light as ordinary spectacle lenses. The technology has received the 2024 Display Component of the Year Award from The Society for Information Display (SID), the world's largest display society. This award is given to technology innovations that change technology trends, and Cellid is the second Japanese company to win this award after major companies such as Sony, Toray, and Japan Display. As a result of the high reputation of AR Glasses within the industry, Cellid is currently collaborating with major companies in Japan and abroad towards the joint development and mass production of AR Glasses in order to promote their widespread use. The Business Development Partner Program enables the joint development and demonstration of applications for the creation of new businesses using AR glasses. Through the program, participating companies can obtain business and service design support, demonstration support and application development support suitable for AR glasses. The OEM Partner Program also enables companies aiming to develop their own AR glasses to develop their own branded AR glasses based on the reference model. The reference model is similar in shape to normal glasses and lighter in weight than conventional head-mounted display AR glasses, enabling use in more everyday situations and supporting industry partnerships and the creation of new businesses. Quote from Cellid CEO, Satoshi ShiragaWe are very pleased to present the reference model for Cellid's proprietary AR glasses. This innovative device has the potential to transform the way we live and work. With the reference model we have presented, we are working to build an ecosystem to further promote AR glasses and expand the market. This ecosystem will provide a place where developers, companies and users can collaborate and grow together. Our goal is to make AR technology more accessible, so that it can be used naturally in everyday life as the real and digital worlds merge. To achieve this, we will strive to follow industry-wide best practices and ensure that users get the most out of their AR experience. Spectacle Type AR Glasses: Key features of reference design 1: Well-designed and lightweight AR glasses in spectacle sizeThe state-of-the-art optical see-through display system with wave-guide optical lenses makes the design and weight (approx. 58 g) as light as normal spectacles, and the fit is less tiring than conventional head-mounted display types, even after long periods of daily use.2: Seamless AR spatial experience with high-resolution cameras & IMU sensorsWith an 8MP high-resolution, 84-degree wide-angle camera and a 3-axis IMU sensor, it can also recognize objects and positions in real space, enabling users to experience a more seamless AR space. 3: Building AR spaces with superior UI/UX It can be connected to Android and Windows devices and uses its own SDK for development, allowing AR spaces and AR content to be built easily and with excellent UI/UX for each use case. 4: SDKs for a wide variety of use cases The SDK of the reference model comes standard with an API for generative AI, which enables its use in a wide range of use cases. For example, by asking through the reference model how to use a device in front of you, the device can be automatically recognized, and the usage and operating instructions can be displayed. In addition, by registering content to AR markers, it is possible to recognize the AR markers and display the content in real space, allowing users to instantly check equipment manuals and other hands-free information. Furthermore, additional eye tracking and gesture recognition functions are planned for the future. ### About CellidCellid's core business is development of AR glass display modules, mainly waveguides and spatial recognition engines for next-generation devices. Cellid's unique optical simulation technology and proprietary production technology have enabled the development of display modules that are as thin and light as ordinary eyeglass lenses, with clear images and one of the world's largest fields of view for waveguides. Cellid also develops and provides industry-specific solutions using spatial recognition software technologies such as Cellid SLAM. By combining AR display hardware technology and real-world spatial recognition software technology, we are accelerating \"Blending the Physical and Digital Worlds,\" and leading the realization of extraordinary information tools that are more accessible and convenient for humans.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2024-12-03 14:00:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://mma.prnasia.com/media2/2570969/Cellid_Logo.jpg?p=medium600", "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_priority": 1333464, "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/en_prnasisa.png", "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top"], "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "e9c3f8aaba480b19df479d836b4b8624", "title": "\u0627\u0654\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u062d\u0627\u064a\u0654\u0644 \u064a\u0632\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0654\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u0648\u064a\u062f\u0634\u0646 \"\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0641\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0646\u062f\u0633\u064a\u0629\" \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0643\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0655\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a", "link": "https://www.al-madina.com/article/914142/%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA/%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B7%D9%82%D8%A9-%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%B4%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%85%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A", "keywords": null, "creator": ["info@al-madina.com (al madina)"], "video_url": null, "description": "\u0632\u0627\u0631 \u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0654\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0628\u0646 \u0633\u0639\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0654\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u062d\u0627\u064a\u0654\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645, \u0645\u0642\u0631 \u0627\u0654\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u062d\u0627\u064a\u0654\u0644\u060c \u0628\u062d\u0636\u0648\u0631 \u0648\u0643\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0655\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0646 \u0633\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0653\u0644 \u0639\u0627\u0645\u0631\u060c \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0628\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u062f\u0649 \u0648\u0635\u0648\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0654\u0645\u064a...", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2024-12-03 14:00:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://www.al-madina.com/uploads/images/2024/12/03/2364262.png", "source_id": "al_madina", "source_priority": 315538, "source_name": "\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629", "source_url": "https://www.al-madina.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/al_madina.png", "language": "arabic", "country": ["saudi arabia"], "category": ["top"], "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "08f6492a0bee52f5cce70930738eb335", "title": "Unlock the Wonders of the World with New Blippi and SHEIN Collaboration", "link": "https://en.prnasia.com/story/471407-0.shtml", "keywords": ["hou", "con", "rea", "fas", "tex", "chi", "pdt"], "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "With Playful Designs, the Collaboration Inspires the Next Generation of Young Adventurers LOS ANGELES, Dec. 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, SHEIN, a global fashion and lifestyle online retailer, collaborated with Blippi, one of the world's most popular live-action children's brands.

With Clarifai's new compute orchestration capabilities, customers can maximize their compute investments, better leverage their cloud commitments and hardware for AI, and seamlessly use Clarifai's SaaS compute \u2014 all while centrally managing and monitoring costs, performance, and governance. Clarifai is the only platform capable of building and orchestrating AI workloads across any hardware provider, cloud provider, on-premises, or air-gapped environment, which helps enterprises eliminate vendor lock-in. \"Clarifai has always been ahead of the curve, with over a decade of experience supporting large enterprise and mission-critical government needs with the full stack of AI tools to create custom AI workloads. Now, we're opening up capabilities we built internally to optimize our compute costs as we scaled to serve millions of models simultaneously. Our customers can now have the same world-leading tools to scale their AI workloads on their compute, wherever it may be,\" said Matt Zeiler, Ph.D., Founder and CEO of Clarifai. \"As generative AI grows, our platform enables customers to reduce complexity and seamlessly build and deploy AI in minutes, at a lower cost, with room to scale and flex to meet future business needs easily.\" As one of the fastest, production-grade deep learning platforms for developers, data scientists, and MLOps/ML engineers to build on, Clarifai's compute orchestration layer provides unique benefits, including the ability to: Cost-efficiently use compute and abstract away complexity. With an easy-to-use control plane, customers can effectively govern access to AI resources, monitor performance, and manage costs while Clarifai's expert-built platform handles dependencies and optimizations. The platform can automatically optimize resource usage through model packing, simple dependency management, and customizable autoscaling options, including scale-to-zero for both model replicas and compute nodes. These optimizations have been shown to reduce compute usage by 3.7x through model packing and support 1.6 million+ inputs per second with 99.9997% reliability. Depending on the configuration, this can lead to reduced costs of at least 60% and up to 90%. Deploy on any hardware or environment. Customers can deploy any model using any hardware vendor in any cloud, on-premises, air-gapped, or SaaS environment for inference. Most competitors focus on inference in managed cloud or customer Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) deployments. Few offer on-premises offerings, and none offer air-gapped environment support with proven success in meeting standards for the most demanding military deployments. Integrate with a full stack of world-leading AI tools. Clarifai offers a full-stack platform for the whole AI lifecycle: data labeling, training, evaluation, workflows, and feedback, which is easy enough for any team to collaborate on. This allows teams to customize AI workloads for their business needs in minutes and seamlessly integrate with compute orchestration to route those workloads to the optimal compute dynamically. Maintain enterprise security and flexibility. Clarifai can deploy the compute plane into a customer's cloud VPC or on-premise Kubernetes cluster without opening up ports into the customer environment, setting up VPC peering, or creating custom Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles in their cloud or data centers. Admins are also able to allocate access to AI resources across teams and projects. This allows users to manage, monitor, and efficiently utilize multiple compute planes from a single control plane without sacrificing security. Clarifai's team of researchers engaged deeply with customers to understand their challenges in optimizing AI performance and spend. Customers highlighted the need for tools that enable cost-effective scaling, seamless provisioning, and flexibility. \"It's the only way you can scale in the end because you make the choices easier for the practitioners rather than getting them to go back to the AI engineering every time, or even worse, trying to upskill them on cloud computing,\" one customer noted. Others emphasized the importance of optionality across environments, \"If we had a way to think about it holistically and look at our on-prem costs compared to our cloud costs, and then be able to orchestrate across environments with a cost basis, that would be incredibly valuable,\" another said. Clarifai's compute orchestration innovation extends Clarifai's focus and leadership position beyond Computer Vision. With over 2 billion operations powering AI for vision, language, and audio, Clarifai has consistently maintained 99.99+% uptime and 24/7 availability, delivering the reliability and flexibility needed for critical applications.
