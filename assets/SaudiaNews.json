'stablization force'", "description": "JAKARTA \u2014 Indonesia is preparing thousands of troops for a potential deployment to Gaza as part of a proposed international post-war security arrangement under US President Donald Trump\u2019s Gaza plan, the country's military has said.Following a leadership meeting chaired by President Prabowo Subianto in Jakarta, Indonesian army began preparations for a possible deployment of up to 8,000 personnel as part of amultinational \"stabilization force\" in Gaza, becoming the first country to do so as part of the US-brokered ceasefire agreement late last year.Army Chief of Staff Maruli Simanjuntak said the numbers and timeline remain under review pending coordination within the military command structure, according to an official Indonesian military statement released Monday.Officials indicated the force would consist mainly of engineering and medical units, emphasizing humanitarian work and reconstruction rather than combat operations.General Simanjuntak said training for the soldiers had already begun, and they would focus on medical and engineering roles in Gaza.Indonesia has joined President Donald Trump's Board of Peace, which was announced last month.The UN Security Council has approved an International Stabilization Force (ISF), which will help secure border areas in Gaza and ensure the territory's demilitarisation, including the disarmament of Hamas.The board, which is due to have its first meeting in Washington on 19 February, will also oversee a new technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza and post-war reconstruction.The timing of the Indonesian troop deployment and their exact role in Gaza have not yet been finalized.Israel's public broadcaster Kan reported that an area in southern Gaza, between Rafah and Khan Younis, had already been designated for use by the Indonesian army to build a barracks for several thousand troops.President Prabowo's decision to join Trump's Board of Peace has been criticized in Indonesia, where there has been widespread public anger over the US role in Israel's bombardment of Gaza.However, Prabowo has argued that, as the world's largest Muslim nation, Indonesia should help stabilize Gaza, and has said that its involvement would be in pursuit of an eventual two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Other Muslim countries like Turkey and Pakistan are also considering sending their troops, but have made it clear they would be peacekeepers only, and would not get involved in the planned disarmament of Hamas, which is refusing to lay down its arms while Israel continues to occupy parts of Gaza. \u2014 Agencies", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["\u0622\u062e\u0631

It's Surprisingly Short to sell your car with Carro The campaign is brought to life through a series of assets that feature everyday objects which have been deliberately and dramatically shortened using AI, bringing out Carro's straightforward and delightful car-selling process: short 15-minute response times, efficient 30-minute inspections and fast payment up to 24 hours \u2013 a process supported by Carro's AI capabilities. Carro's longtime use of machine learning models and AI runs deep through its everyday operations, especially in customer service and fleet management for its car-selling processes. For example, when a customer submits their details, they immediately interact with Carro's agentic AI tool, which quickly responds to common enquiries and requests, before being routed to the right person if necessary. This allows Carro to effectively resolve all customer queries and set up an appointment in less than 15 minutes. \"We've seen how vexing car-selling can be, from long drawn conversations to confusing inspection processes. That's why we're always constantly improving our customer service and AI inspection app to give customers the best car valuation as soon as we can,\" says Carro Chief Operating Officer Chua Zi Yong. \"With our use of technology and machine learning models, our accurate inspections and fair valuations give sellers the confidence when they sell their cars to us, all whilst transacting quickly.\" \"We're constantly hearing how our customers are pleasantly surprised to know that we make full payments within 24 hours, or that we reply within 15 minutes,\" says Carro Chief Marketing Officer Katherine Teo. \"It was really important to us to showcase how surprisingly short our car-selling process is and for this process to be the new standard for customers who want a transparent, straightforward experience.\" To emphasise the 'shortened' aspect of Carro's car-selling process, their in-house Creative team utilised AI models to reimagine a whimsical life full of everyday objects that have been deliberately cropped. The team was also able to to create visuals that were very specific to Carro's messaging needs, ensuring assets were heavily optimised for performance across multiple markets. \"By exploring AI tools, we were able to test the boundaries of AI as a creative collaborator, as well as understand the power and limitations of generative AI,\" says Shane Lim, Carro Associate Creative Director. \"Through manual adjustments and by repeatedly testing, fine-tuning and reviewing our AI models, we were able to ensure that our visuals were both creative yet still aligned perfectly with our brand guidelines and standards. We're proud to say that key phases of the creative lifecycle for this campaign were still powered by human insight and brainstorming \u2013 specifically our concept creation, multi-language localisation and feedback loops.\" The campaign will run across digital and social channels in Singapore, Malaysia, and Hong Kong SAR.
