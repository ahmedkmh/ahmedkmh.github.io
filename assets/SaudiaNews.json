Working in Curac\u0327ao in the southern Caribbean, she will test new laboratory methods for fertilizing coral eggs, a critical process that often fails when corals are rare or stressed. Marhaver aims to help scientists and restoration teams efficiently use coral gene banks and expand captive breeding of endangered corals. Aileen Maypa, Ph.D. Silliman University, Philippines Aileen Maypa will develop science-based and community-friendly protocols to help accelerate the recovery of coral reefs in the Philippines. Collaborating with scientists, conservation practitioners, and national government agencies, she will convene the first nationwide coral restoration-focused network in the Philippines. She will also work with local communities to develop accessible toolkits documenting effective practices for reef restoration. Edy Setyawan, Ph.D. Elasmobranch Institute Indonesia, Indonesia Edy Setyawan will investigate the life history, population dynamics, and movement patterns of Raja Ampat epaulette sharks to help determine conservation priorities for the species. Using a combination of approaches, including photographic identification, radio frequency identification, acoustic telemetry, and biologging, he will assess their population status, investigate their habitat preferences, and identify key threats to the sharks and help guide the design of effective protections. Hesti Widodo, Ph.D. Coral Triangle Center, Indonesia Hesti Widodo will work with seven pilot sites in Indonesia seeking government verification as \"Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures\" (OECMs), a promising new conservation approach to develop a method for evaluating and reporting their impact. Working closely with communities through consultations and focus group discussions, she will develop indicators to evaluate the inclusion and equitable distribution of OECM benefits to ensure that they meet community needs.

NAVER D2SF, the Corporate Venturing Arm of NAVER, initially discovered MOVIN during its early startup phase and provided seed funding in 2023. Following the company's successful product development and future growth potential, NAVER D2SF decided to make an additional investment. MOVIN has pioneered the world's first real-time markerless motion capture technology utilizing a LiDAR sensor. By leveraging a LiDAR sensor, the technology captures spatial information such as distance and depth without distortion, enabling precise 3D joint, bone structure, and angle tracking. What sets MOVIN apart is its ability to deliver clean, AI-processed motion data in real time \u2014 no complex setups, no extra hardware, and no manual post-processing required. This makes it easy to plug into any real-time workflow, offering seamless integration with major game engines and content pipelines. The result: a truly scalable, accessible solution for creators across industries. MOVIN launched its first flagship product, \"MOVIN TRACIN,\" and is actively expanding its global business. The company was recognized as one of the top 10 real-time technology companies at \"SIGGRAPH 2024 Real-Time Live.\" It has already secured over 50 clients across 11 countries, including companies in the gaming, VFX, and virtual production industries. At GDC 2025, MOVIN's markerless motion capture solution was highlighted for its ease of setup and superior quality, earning positive feedback across the board. The solution stood out for its ease of use and exceptional results. Furthermore, MOVIN plans to launch a 3D motion data generation and distribution platform in the second half of the year. The company has already secured a large volume of triple datasets, combining LiDAR, RGB camera, and motion capture data\u2014a rare combination globally. This acquisition enables 20% higher data production efficiency compared to existing solutions. Yang Sang-hwan, Head of NAVER D2SF, stated, \"3D motion data is essential for AI to understand human movements and behaviors. Its demand will continue to grow not only in the entertainment sector, such as VTubers and games, but also in robotics and healthcare. MOVIN is a rapidly growing team with outstanding execution capabilities, and we expect them to expand beyond 3D motion capture into a 3D motion data platform.\" Choi Byeoli, CEO of MOVIN, commented, \"We have developed technology that precisely generates and predicts high-quality 3D motion data in real-time, enabling us to provide AI training datasets for various industries, including gaming and humanoid robotics. At GDC 2025, we saw strong promise in our technology, which will serve as a stepping stone to establish a North American branch this year and accelerate our global business expansion.\" Meanwhile, NAVER is integrating its technology into 3D content services, delivering new user experiences.
