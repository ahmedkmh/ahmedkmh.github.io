This high-impact, scenario-driven platform connects global spirits, wine, and craft beer brands with Asia's most influential bar and hospitality buyers, providing immersive experiences, direct engagement, and unparalleled commercial opportunities across China and the region. The new vertical transforms traditional exhibition into a practical business environment for market entry and expansion, enabling brands to engage buyers, showcase products, and build lasting partnerships in a rapidly recovering market. Scheduled for March 30 to April 2, 2026, at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai, HOTELEX Shanghai 2026 will once again operate at unmatched scale, welcoming over 300,000 professional visitors across 400,000 square meters, with more than 3,800 exhibitors and 12,000 overseas buyers.

Exhibitors gain direct access to bar owners, hospitality groups, distributors, importers, and lifestyle-driven buyers, creating unparalleled opportunities for market entry and business growth. To enhance commercial outcomes, The Bar & Drinks Shanghai integrates mixology showcases, bartender competitions, bar design and equipment solutions, as well as non-alcoholic beverages and sustainable packaging, providing multiple touchpoints for brand visibility, lead generation, and partnership development.
