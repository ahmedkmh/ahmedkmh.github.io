academic excellence in the UK, Queen Elizabeth's School, Barnet, in partnership with GEDU Global Education, has secured initial approval from the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) to open its first international branch campus in Dubai in August 2026. To be known as Queen Elizabeth's School, Dubai Sports City, the new branch campus will provide young people in the UAE with access to the National Curriculum for England, delivered to the exacting academic standards that have seen Queen Elizabeth's School in Barnet consistently recognised as Outstanding by Ofsted and ranked at the very top of the UK league tables. \"This landmark approval allows us to accelerate our vision to deliver world-leading K-12 education to students from across the UAE,\" said Caroline Pendleton-Nash, CEO of Queen Elizabeth's Global Schools. \"While the model of establishing international branches is familiar among leading UK independent schools, this marks the first time in history that a distinguished UK state grammar school has embarked upon such a partnership. It represents an unprecedented and truly exciting milestone for global education. Queen Elizabeth's School, Dubai Sports City, will be a co-educational school, opening initially from Nursery to Year 8, with a phased growth through to Sixth Form. Its location in Dubai Sports City affords our students privileged access to unrivalled sporting facilities, embedding sport and physical excellence as a defining pillar of their education. This will be brought to life through our QE Flourish Programme, which nurtures character and personal development across the strands of Care, Challenge, Create and Compete, realising the boundless potential of our students. The Dubai branch campus will remain faithful to the mission, ethos, tradition, and exacting academic standards of Queen Elizabeth's School, Barnet, while embracing Dubai's spirit of innovation and ambition. Our mission is to nurture confident, able, and responsible young people who are prepared to lead happy and fulfilled adult lives and to make a positive contribution to others. In uniting the heritage of one of the UK's most distinguished schools with the vision of Dubai, we aspire to set a new global benchmark for educational excellence.\" Neil Enright, Headmaster of Queen Elizabeth's School, Barnet said: \"We are delighted to have received this encouragement from the KHDA to offer a rounded and enriching QE education to children in the UAE, spreading opportunity and supporting students to become the leaders of their generation. \"We are also excited by the potential for international collaboration, which, in time, will build a global network of Elizabethans for the benefit of our new students as well as those within the state sector in Barnet.\" Edward Hobart, His Majesty's Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates said, \"I am delighted that Queen Elizabeth's School will open in Dubai Sports City next year. This milestone represents the first time a British state funded grammar school has expanded globally, testament to the enduring strength of UK-UAE educational partnerships. \"By bringing QE's proven educational methodology and 450-year heritage of academic excellence to Dubai, it increases the opportunity for young people in the UAE to access world-class British education. I look forward to seeing the positive impact this world-class institution will have on students and the broader educational landscape in the UAE.\" Founded in 1573 by a royal charter from Queen Elizabeth I, Queen Elizabeth's is a grammar school with over 450 years of rich heritage and a pioneering tradition. The school is a UK leader, providing a rounded education to students from diverse and modest backgrounds, based on merit. A Queen Elizabeth's School education routinely surpasses the provision of most of the UK's most expensive and selective independent schools and QE's results consistently place the School at the very top of UK league tables for both the independent and state sector. Queen Elizabeth's School was named 2025 Sunday Times State Secondary School of the Year for A-levels. In 2024, 55% of leavers held offers from an institution in the top five of the QS World University Rankings.

production and storage to utilization GYEONGJU, South Korea, Oct. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Hyundai Motor Group (the Group) today held a high-level dialogue on hydrogen strategy at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit Korea 2025. Hyundai Motor Group Vice Chair and Hydrogen Council Co-Chair, Jaehoon Chang, joined Hydrogen Council CEO, Ivana Jemelkova, to discuss the current state of the hydrogen industry and its role in sustainable growth across the Asia-Pacific region. (from left) Ivana Jemelkova, CEO of Hydrogen Council, and Jaehoon Chang, Vice Chair of Hyundai Motor Group and Co-Chair of Hydrogen Council Under the theme \"Bridge, Business and Beyond,\" the APEC CEO Summit brought together global leaders to address challenges such as regional integration, digital transformation, and sustainability. In the session titled \"Hydrogen, Beyond Mobility, New Energy for Society\" led by the Group, Vice Chair Chang emphasized hydrogen's role in achieving carbon neutrality and energy resilience, and called for coordinated efforts to accelerate adoption. \"Hydrogen accelerates carbon neutrality by addressing the intermittency of renewables and enhancing energy resilience,\" said Jaehoon Chang, Vice Chair of Hyundai Motor Group. \"Hydrogen also stands out as a strategic energy carrier, enabling localized generation and distribution systems\u2014such as off-grid and microgrid ecosystems\u2014that reduce reliance on centralized grids and strengthen communities' self-sufficiency.\" During the session, Vice Chair Chang and Hydrogen Council CEO, Ivana Jemelkova, shared insights on the Global Hydrogen Compass 2025, which outlines a pivotal moment for the industry\u2014shifting from ambition to delivery with USD 110 billion of committed capital across 510 projects past financial investment decision globally. \"Since 2020, global capital commitments to clean hydrogen have grown ten times\u2015a remarkable trajectory,\" said Ivana Jemelkova, CEO of Hydrogen Council. \"Our next big test is demand which requires clear, practical and stable policies and strong public-private collaboration.

"https://en.prnasia.com/story/509361-0.shtml", "keywords": ["fin", "svy"], "creator": null, "description": "Seven in 10 say ensuring their family's financial security is the most important element of legacy planning. 59% want the wealth they leave behind to be invested in long-term wealth creation. Nearly two-thirds (60%) fear their wealth may not be preserved beyond their children's generation. Less than a third of respondents believe their children will uphold family traditions. Only 19% feel fully prepared in terms of legacy arrangements. HONG KONG, Oct. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- A new survey from Sun Life Asia reveals that while financial security is regarded as a cornerstone for legacy planning across the region, as many as 60% fear their wealth will not last beyond their children's generation, underscoring an urgent need for structured planning and financial literacy in this space. The research, titled Passing the torch: Building lasting legacies in Asia, surveyed over 3,000 respondents across Hong Kong (SAR), Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam, and highlights the attitudes, behaviours and aspirations surrounding legacy planning in Asia. With Asia experiencing the largest intergenerational wealth transfer in the coming decade, effective legacy planning is a growing priority for families across the region to navigate \u2013 not only in terms of financial assets, but in the preservation of values, traditions and opportunities for future generations. Building a legacy of security and opportunity Seven in 10 respondents (70%) say having protection in place to ensure their family's financial security is the most important factor in legacy planning. This is followed by having a clear and smoothly communicated estate plan to reduce confusion or disputes (53%) and building enough wealth to pass down to the next generation (48%). Most respondents prefer the wealth they leave behind to fuel long-term growth, with 59% wanting their legacy invested for long-term wealth creation through financial assets, life insurance or the family business. An equally significant number of people would also like their legacy to meet essentials such as housing and healthcare (59%), followed by funding education from school to college or vocational training (56%). Concerns around legacy not lasting beyond the next generation Nearly two-thirds (60%) fear their wealth may not last beyond their children's generation, and more than half (55%) worry that their heirs are not financially equipped to manage inherited assets, underscoring the urgent need for better financial literacy and open family dialogue about money matters. Only 31% of respondents are confident their children will uphold their wishes around wealth transfer, preserve assets, and continue to grow them. Concerns are most pronounced among the affluent, with 28% describing themselves as \"very concerned\" about wealth preservation, highlighting that greater wealth often brings greater responsibility and considerably higher stakes. David Broom, Chief Client & Distribution Officer at Sun Life, said: \"We are seeing a clear shift in how families define legacy \u2013 from wealth alone to a combination of financial security, education and purposeful living for future generations. While the survey indicates a gap between intent and action, this highlights the need for proactive planning, professional guidance and open family dialogue to ensure both assets and values are preserved.\" Legacy is not just about money \u2013 it's about meaning Asian families define their legacy in multidimensional terms. When asked about the type of legacy they want to leave behind, 41% cite passing on wealth, including money, property, or other valuable assets including family business, followed by family traditions (15%) and wanting to have a personal influence on family and friends (13%). Worries extend beyond financial matters to the preservation of family values \u2014 only 31% of respondents believe their children will uphold family traditions. Diverging priorities among younger generations (58%), limited engagement (39%), misinterpretation of values (30%), and weaker intergenerational bonds (29%) are cited as major factors. David Broom, Chief Client & Distribution Officer at Sun Life, said: \"Today's families view legacy as much more than just financial inheritance \u2013 it's about creating lasting impact by powering financial growth, supporting education and healthcare and even unlocking global opportunities. People want their wealth to work harder, not just for today, but to generate momentum that benefits generations to come.\" Many underprepared despite growing awareness Even as awareness of legacy planning grows across the region, preparedness remains low. Only 19% feel fully prepared in terms of legacy arrangements if they were to pass away today, a figure that rises modestly to 29% among the affluent. Just 10% have completed and communicated their legacy plans, while nearly half (45%) have only partial plans, and 31% admit to having nothing at all. While awareness of tools like wills, trusts and advisors is high, uptake is low. Seven in 10 (70%) know about wills and estate planning documents, yet just 38% use them. Similarly, 67% are aware of financial advisors but only 36% have sought professional advice. Many legacy discussions lack structure. Almost half (44%) of legacy planning conversations are currently informal or casual, but this does not seem to be the preferred option, with just 27% of respondents stating this as the best setting. David Broom, Chief Client & Distribution Officer at Sun Life, said: \"Families are talking but not planning. While more people recognise the need for open conversations about wealth and inheritance, many of these discussions still lack structure and follow through, leaving important legacy decisions unresolved or misunderstood. Formal discussions with the whole family give clarity, prevent conflict, and ensure a more enduring legacy.\" Financial literacy is a valuable family legacy Families are turning financial education into another form of inheritance by passing on knowledge and experience of money management. When asked what actions they have taken, or plan to take to strengthen the next generation's confidence, a majority say they are sharing personal financial experiences (54%), engaging in open financial discussions (53%), and teaching financial basics (53%). Professional guidance towards legacy planning is also in growing demand. 37% of respondents have already engaged advisors, and 42% plan to do so. Affluent individuals lead the way, with 58% having sought advice, while nearly half of Gen Z respondents (47%) intend to do so, reflecting a generational shift toward structured support. David Broom, Chief Client & Distribution Officer at Sun Life, said: \"People today want to pass on more than wealth, they want to give the next generation the knowledge and values to manage it wisely. With financial literacy becoming a key part of one's legacy, we are committed to helping families plan and build legacies that last by providing trusted advice and financial education that can bridge the gap between intention and confidence.\" The full report is available here.
