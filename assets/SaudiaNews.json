The new entity will focus on incubating and integrating smart healthcare hardware, with the aim of building a people-centric health services ecosystem. Market observers expect the initiative to leverage multi-disciplinary technologies such as AIoT, Web3, digital assets and Real World Assets Tokenization (RWA), which could serve as catalysts for a potential re-rating of the Company's valuation. Platform Development Through Technology Integration Home Control is prioritizing innovation by combining in-house R&D with integrated solutions designed for smart home healthcare settings. Its goal is to create a one-stop health management platform that aligns with global demands over the digital transformation of healthcare systems and secure data management. Research indicates that modernization of healthcare data and the establishment of resilient technology infrastructure require the application of cloud computing, generative AI and related emerging technologies. The convergence of AIoT, Web3 and RWA with healthcare is widely viewed as a natural extension of the Company's strategy. To support these ambitions, Home Control has strengthened its Board. Newly appointed Independent Non-Executive Director Mr. Ye Min previously served as Managing Director and Head of International Business at Moody's, and as Chief Executive Officer of China Chengxin International (CCXI), the country's first nationwide credit rating agency. With deep expertise in Web3 finance, risk management and ESG, Mr. Ye is expected to provide strategic and compliance insights as the Company advances into healthcare. Strategic resources in the Asian healthcare market Another new Independent Non-Executive Director, Mr. Chen Yi Chung, adds significant regional healthcare experience. Through OUE Group, a Singapore-listed healthcare and property group, he has overseen investments and operations across Asia. OUE's healthcare subsidiary, Healthway, runs over 130 clinics and medical centers in Singapore, with an expanding footprint in China, Myanmar, Indonesia and Japan. Key milestones include the operation of a hospital in Myanmar (2019), the establishment of an international medical centre in Shenzhen in partnership with the Chinese University of Hong Kong (2023), and the acquisition of a leading Singapore physiotherapy provider (2024). Mr. Chen's expertise and network are expected to be highly complementary to Home Control's healthcare ambitions. Bridging Gaps in the Global Healthcare Ecosystem with Extensive Resources Healthcare data is growing rapidly \u2014 at an estimated CAGR of 36% from 2020 to 2025 \u2014 yet infrastructure and integration remain underdeveloped. These barriers have discouraged many private enterprises from entering the sector. By proposing the creation of a global healthcare services ecosystem, Home Control is aiming to address these gaps by bridging data flows between households and clinics and exploring new healthcare delivery models. The Company's vision is to create a people-focused healthcare network that connects device makers, healthcare service providers, insurers and other stakeholders. Such integration requires advanced technology, strong relationships and deep market insight. Market commentators note that Home Control's increasingly proactive communication of its strategy signals the depth of resources backing its ambitions. Earlier this year, the Company appointed Ms. Ma Ying as a Non-Executive Director. Ms. Ma co-founded the Zhejiang Jack Ma Public Welfare Foundation in 2014 and served as its Chairman and Legal Representative. Her profile in philanthropy and education, along with her ties to leading figures in China's new economy, have fuelled market expectations that she could play a supportive role in Home Control's future healthcare expansion. Global Healthcare at a Digital Inflection Point, showcasing tremendous opportunities Industry consensus suggests that global healthcare systems are at a tipping point where digitalization is no longer optional but urgent. Deloitte's 2025 Global Healthcare Outlook highlights that leaders in markets such as the US, UK, Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and Australia are prioritizing digital transformation and investing heavily in healthcare as a high-growth sector. Against this backdrop, Home Control's entry into healthcare \u2014 supported by new Board members with expertise in Web3, finance and medical services \u2014 positions the Company to capture a meaningful share of this emerging growth opportunity.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-09-15 03:29:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 4111305, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/en_prnasisa.png", "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top", "technology"], "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "ai_content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "cc1ff92dd1cf8b192505b639ab029461", "title": "Trump heads for historic second UK state visit", "link": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/trump-uk-state-visit-royal-family-starmer-5349411", "keywords": ["world"], "creator": ["CNA"], "description": "WASHINGTON: Donald Trump will get the red carpet treatment this week on an unprecedented second United Kingdom state visit, as Britain counts on royal pomp and circumstance to woo the unpredictable United States", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-09-15 03:26:17", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s---JWaVfDV--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2023-11:afp_watermark_14112023,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_468,w_830/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2025/09/15/donald_trump_3_mod.jpg?itok=obG9WZ9f", "video_url": null, "source_id": "channelnewsasia", "source_name": "Channel Newsasia", "source_priority": 4763, "source_url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/channelnewsasia.jpg", "language": "english", "country": ["georgia", "yemen", "afghanistan", "cyprus", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "maldives", "japan", "united arab emirates", "malaysia", "china", "south korea", "north korea", "taiwan", "thailand", "pakistan", "mongolia", "brunei", "lebanon", "indonesia", "kyrgyzstan", "syria", "israel", "bhutan", "iran", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "kazakhstan", "iraq", "bangladesh", "laos", "vietnam", "timor-leste", "kuwait", "myanmar", "azerbaijan", "jordan", "nepal", "sri lanka", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "cambodia", "tajikistan"], "category": ["world"], "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "ai_content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": true}, {"article_id": "63a86f1c4c8a9550e14c380688b07297", "title": "Japan\u2019s railgun takes the sting out of China\u2019s hypersonics", "link": "https://asiatimes.com/2025/09/japans-railgun-takes-the-sting-out-of-chinas-hypersonics/", "keywords": ["laser weapons", "china hypersonic missiles", "japan maritime self defense force", "military", "sm-3 interceptor", "aegis ashore", "japan railgun", "df-17 hypersonic missile", "japan atla", "hypersonic warfare", "block 1"], "creator": ["Gabriel Honrada"], "description": "Japan has fired the first ship-mounted railgun at sea, a hypersonic shot that could rewrite the balance between guns and missiles in naval warfare.
