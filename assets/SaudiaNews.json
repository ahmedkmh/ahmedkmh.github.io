(Xinhua/Cao Yang) The China-Central Asia Cooperation Development Forum and the Third Silk Road International Communication Forum were held on Sunday in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan. Around 240 representatives from media, think tanks, cultural institutions and business sectors across China and Central Asia engaged in in-depth discussions on topics including deepening Silk Road cooperation. At the opening ceremony, Arman Kyrykbayev, assistant to the Kazakh president, read a congratulatory message from Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. In the letter, Tokayev noted that not long ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping and the heads of state of the five Central Asian countries attended the second China-Central Asia Summit, which concluded with great success. He said the China-Central Asia Cooperation Development Forum and the Third Silk Road International Communication Forum serve as important platforms for people-to-people dialogue and cultural exchange between Central Asian countries and China.

In his keynote speech, Fu Hua, president of Xinhua News Agency, said President Xi attaches great importance to China-Central Asia cooperation and development. A stable, prosperous, harmonious and interconnected Central Asia is of great significance to the entire world, Fu said. Fu said that Xinhua is willing to work together with media outlets and think tanks from Central Asian countries to strengthen media exchanges and deepen cooperation in areas such as news reporting, technological development and personnel exchanges, carry out joint research on topics of common interest based on the realities and development needs of China and Central Asia, enhance field studies, analytical assessments and sharing of information and achievements, and produce more high-quality and actionable think tank reports to offer insights and recommendations for the development of China-Central Asia cooperation. Qiu Xiaoqi, vice president of the China Public Diplomacy Association, said the launch of the China-Central Asia forum marks a new chapter of exchange and cooperation among the media, think tanks and cultural institutions of the six countries. All parties should make earnest efforts to better tell the stories of China-Central Asia cooperation and the modernization of the Global South, he said. Tursunali Kuziev, first deputy director of Uzbekistan's Cultural Heritage Agency, said the Uzbek side fully agrees with the proverb \"a close neighbor is better than a distant relative,\" and remains committed to building a good-neighborly and mutually beneficial relationship between Central Asia and China. He expressed hope that the event would serve as an efficient platform for exchanging ideas, inspiring creativity and charting future cooperation. Chinese Ambassador to Kazakhstan Han Chunlin said the \"China-Central Asia Spirit\" reflects the six countries' strong commitment to good-neighborly relations, solidarity and mutual support. He called on the media, as a bridge for people-to-people connections, to promote a favorable public opinion environment for the high-quality development of China-Central Asia relations. Sun Weidong, secretary-general of the Secretariat of the China-Central Asia Mechanism, said in his speech that think tanks and media from the six countries bear an important responsibility in strengthening the social foundation of a China-Central Asia community with a shared future. The Secretariat of the China-Central Asia Mechanism stands ready to work closely with all parties, actively support cooperation mechanisms and platforms in various fields, and contribute to building a closer China-Central Asia community with a shared future.

The maintenance enhances the reliability of offshore wind power transmission, ensuring stable power supply during the peak summer demand period. The seven-day maintenance operation covered three offshore sites\u2014the \u00b1400 kV Huangshayang Converter Station, the 220 kV Xiatong and Xiaru Step-up Stations\u2014as well as the onshore \u00b1400 kV Lvgu Converter Station. The Huangshayang facility, the world's largest offshore flexible DC converter station by capacity and voltage class, serves as the central hub for aggregating wind power from three offshore wind farms in Rudong, with a total installed capacity of 1.1 gigawatts (GW). Chen Yong, Director of the Maintenance Department at Jiangsu Power Transmission and Transformation Company, said, \"With an annual power output of 3.3 billion kWh, the station accounts for nearly 10% of Jiangsu's offshore wind power capacity, enough to offset about 5% of the province's peak summer demand shortfall.\" To ensure a smooth operation, a professional team of over 100 personnel from the company performed a full-spectrum inspection of high-voltage primary and secondary systems, converter valves, thermal management infrastructure, and other mission-critical components. The team successfully executed 312 maintenance tasks across all four sites. As the three offshore sites are located nearly 70 kilometers from the coast, coordinating of personnel, equipment and supplies posed a major logistical challenge. Wang Xiangjun, the project leader, explained that the team adopted a \"dynamic grid management\" approach, assigning tasks to designated individuals for real-time progress monitoring and closed-loop quality assurance. During execution, the team combined aerial pivoting and segmented positioning techniques to achieve millimeter-grade alignment in the installation of large equipment, addressing the spatial constraints of the offshore converter platform.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-06-24 06:38:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?DateId=20250624&NewsItemId=AE15841&Transmission_Id=202506240238PR_NEWS_ASPR_____AE15841", "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 1333464, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/en_prnasisa.png", "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top"], "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "b6fe71d5bf79f793359d355a1c0b3fd8", "title": "Forum held to promote cooperation between China, Central Asia news agencies", "link": "https://en.prnasia.com/story/494142-0.shtml", "keywords": ["pub", "tds", "for"], "creator": null, "description": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan, June 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- This is a report from Xinhuanet: President of Xinhua News Agency Fu Hua attends the China-Central Asia News Agency Forum in Astana, Kazakhstan, June 22, 2025.
