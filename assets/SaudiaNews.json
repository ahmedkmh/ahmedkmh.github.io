(SKS) and its visionary leader, Chairman Richard Wu, achieved a remarkable double victory at the Asia Pacific Enterprise Awards (APEA) 2025 Taiwan Chapter, organized by Enterprise Asia, with Chairman Wu receiving the Master Entrepreneur award and the company honored with the Corporate Excellence award. These prestigious recognitions reflect both the company's transformative growth and Chairman Wu's pioneering leadership in redefining Taiwan's security industry. Chairman Wu has been instrumental in driving Shin Kong Security's evolution into a cutting-edge, AI-powered surveillance and logistics platform. Under his leadership, the company now manages 3.8 million security devices across 100,000 customers. Chairman Wu's unique journey\u2014from co-founding Compulsion Games in Montreal, later acquired by Microsoft, to leading a traditional security company\u2014has given him a rare blend of startup agility and corporate leadership experience. Drawing inspiration from the gaming industry, Chairman Wu introduced AI systems that enhance rather than replace human capabilities, transforming Shin Kong Security's traditional reliance on manpower into a modern, technology-driven operation. His innovative strategies have improved service quality, streamlined operations, and demonstrated how traditional industries can responsibly embrace innovation while preserving jobs and elevating customer experiences. Founded in 1980, Shin Kong Security has been a trusted leader in Taiwan's security sector for over four decades. The company delivers AI-driven solutions to commercial, public, and residential clients, with a mission to create safer, smarter, and more sustainable communities. Guided by its vision of \"dual transformation\"\u2014integrating technological innovation with sustainable development\u2014Shin Kong Security prioritizes digitalization, ESG initiatives, and talent development to create lasting value for stakeholders. Beyond its core business, Shin Kong Security is deeply committed to corporate social responsibility. Since 2007, its An-Shin Classroom initiative has provided safety and environmental education to schools and communities, teaching vital skills such as disaster preparedness, fraud prevention, and anti-bullying strategies. In 2024 alone, the program reached 1,830 participants through 31 sessions, with employees serving as \"safety ambassadors\" to spread awareness and foster a culture of care. Through the SKS Community Care Welfare Foundation, the company also supports intergenerational connections through services like the Fangqiao Day Care Center and contributes to sustainable agriculture by partnering with young farmers to produce organic rice, donating 27,600 kilograms to families in need since 2015. This dual recognition at APEA 2025 reflects not only Shin Kong Security's legacy of trust and innovation but also Richard Wu's transformative leadership. Together, they are shaping the future of security services by combining advanced technology, sustainable practices, and a deep commitment to community well-being\u2014paving the way for a safer and smarter Taiwan.

While more than a third of Mastercard transactions worldwide are already tokenized, achieving that vision in the world's largest and fastest-growing e-commerce market \u2014 projected to exceed USD 7 trillion by 2030[1] \u2014 will require collective action. That's why Mastercard is rallying banks, merchants, digital wallets, and technology partners to enable secure, tokenized payments powered by biometric authentication. This eliminates manual card entry and static passwords, making checkout faster and safer for consumers. Building on progress in India\u2014where Mastercard worked with regulators, banks, and merchants to deliver near-complete tokenization for e-commerce\u2014the next phase targets full adoption in Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam by 2027. These markets are driving Southeast Asia's rapid digitization, with digital payments expected to account for 94% of e-commerce transactions in a market worth USD 325 billion by 2028[2]. As online shopping accelerates, so do its challenges. Card-not-present fraud remains seven times higher than in-store [3], with global losses expected to surpass USD 100 billion by 2029[4]. Meanwhile, eight in 10[5] shoppers abandon their carts, nearly half citing checkout frustration. Mastercard's answer: replace passwords and card numbers with secure tokens and on-device biometrics, reducing friction through Click to Pay and building trust across every device and platform. Proof in Every Transaction Where tokenization is live, approval rates have risen by up to 6%, generating more than USD 2 billion in additional sales each month for merchants [6]. The impact is tangible: Merchants see faster, more reliable checkouts and stronger security, leading to higher customer satisfaction and increased sales. Consumers enjoy one-step payments with no forgotten passwords or declines. Digital wallets integrate seamlessly, offering users simpler, safer payments at over 150 million Mastercard-accepted merchants worldwide. \"The vision is simple: no passwords, no manual card entry, no friction,\" said Sandeep Malhotra, Executive Vice President, Core Payments, Asia Pacific, Mastercard. \"By uniting the industry, Mastercard is accelerating adoption of tokenization and payment passkeys to create a single, secure experience for password-free payments. As a result, approval rates are rising, fraud is falling, and millions of shoppers are enjoying faster, safer checkouts. Partners who join this movement will help shape the future of intelligent commerce in Asia Pacific.\" The Next Paradigm Shift Just as payments once moved from cash to digital, the next evolution is from digital to intelligent \u2014 powered by AI, data, and connected networks. Advances in tokenization and authentication are paving the way for agentic commerce, where trusted digital assistants shop and pay securely on behalf of consumers. Tokenization and passkeys aren't the finish line; they're the foundation for a smarter, more secure future that will unlock new possibilities for people and businesses alike. Building on Global Momentum This regional roadmap builds on Mastercard's global launch of its Payment Passkey Service in India, where the company partnered with leading banks and merchants to debut device-based biometric checkout for millions of shoppers. That success proved how passkeys can boost both security and simplicity \u2014 now setting the stage for Mastercard's 2030 vision across Asia Pacific.

With the support of SBF and SA, the SME Sustainability Barometer deep-dives into the challenges faced by SMEs in going green, and offers ecosystem-wide recommendations for how the public and private sectors can partner to help SMEs better capture opportunities in green procurement, financing and business growth. More ecosystem support for local SMEs SMEs are the backbone of the economy and central to the nation's low-carbon transition. Despite this, the Barometer found that three in four SMEs1 had yet to commence their sustainability journeys, citing constraints in money, skills and time as the top barriers: Money: More than half of SMEs studied viewed sustainability as hard to justify in view of tight operating margins and more pressing business needs, with four in five citing a lack of clarity on the tangible returns from their investments. Skills: Three in four SMEs lack the technical know-how needed to translate sustainability into concrete action plans and demonstrable outcomes. Time: Over 40% of SMEs cited limited availability of time and resources, compounded by rising economic pressures stemming from geopolitical tensions. This leaves little bandwidth to properly explore the range of available programmes and opportunities. Over 70% of SMEs have not accessed any form of government assistance or available support despite the availability of various schemes, which suggests persistent challenges in awareness, accessibility, and perceived relevance of such schemes. These findings highlight the need for stronger public-private collaboration to help SMEs get started on and stay engaged in sustainability. As an immediate step, the Barometer features 'tear sheets' that point SMEs to readily available resources, with future editions set to broaden and consolidate more assistance from across the local ecosystem. \"We must enable SMEs to view sustainability not as a cost to bear, but as a business strategy for securing their place in the carbon constrained economy of the future.\" said Ravi Menon, Singapore's Ambassador for Climate Action. \"Environmental sustainability will become an increasingly important driver of competitiveness and new growth, as climate change intensifies in the years and decades ahead. Supply chains and customers have begun to prioritise companies that demonstrate credible climate action and will increasingly do so. Going green is not about compliance \u2013 it is about staying relevant and resilient.\" Strengthening collaboration toward focused outcomes The Barometer goes beyond these immediate measures to propose five sets of key recommendations that greatly enhance the sustainability value proposition for SMEs. Delivering these will require stronger coordination across the public and private sectors, reflecting the shared responsibility of greening the SME community at scale: Help SMEs realise the value of sustainability: Only 10% of SMEs starting out on sustainability reported measurable gains, compared to nearly half of those in a more mature state. A central case bank that consolidates success stories, supported by data and benchmarks to quantify the benefits, could spur more SMEs to follow suit. Help SMEs get started with clear and simple steps: Once SMEs recognise the value of sustainability, they need clear first steps. The Barometer recommends that SMEs designate a staff member to 'champion' their sustainability effort, who can be guided by a simple and practical first-year roadmap to deliver quick, visible wins. Help SMEs scale their efforts through flagship programmes: As SMEs progress, sustained engagement and incentivisation are key. Flagship initiatives like sustainability-focused Queen Bee programmes \u2013 where large corporates engage SME suppliers and customers to build green capabilities \u2013 have proven effective, with 86% of participants reporting business benefits from such programmes. These gains can be amplified through government leadership and tighter public-private coordination to expand green procurement opportunities for SMEs. Help SMEs keep costs trim through shared solutions: 46% cite high costs of sustainable materials and solutions as a major barrier. SMEs can reduce expenses by pooling common activities to achieve economies of scale, and trade associations can play a pivotal role in identifying shared challenges and co-creating sector-wide solutions with government partners. Help SMEs be recognised for their efforts: SMEs should be recognised for their sustainability progress and be able to convert this into meaningful business and financing advantages. A unified sustainability 'passport' can simplify this process by helping SMEs navigate fragmented certification landscapes and showcase their progress in a clear, credible way. \"When SMEs go green, they don't act alone. They lift the networks around them \u2013 their buyers, suppliers, customers, and financiers. They green the value chains they power, and in doing so generate high-quality data from the ground up,\" said Lionel Wong, Gprnt's Chief Executive Officer. \"Gprnt's digital utilities play a catalytic role in helping businesses to automatically generate their basic sustainability metrics at no cost, which greatly lowers the barrier for local SMEs to get started. But to truly bring SMEs into the fold, we need to go further by layering clearer market signals and stronger incentives atop these foundations, in the form of green procurement, financing, and market access opportunities. This requires collective effort across the public and private sectors to make sustainability not just viable, but valuable.\" Lee Bing Yi, Financial Services Assurance, Sustainability and Climate Change Partner at PwC Singapore added: \"Nearly three-quarters of Singapore's SMEs have yet to tap available sustainability support. Closing this gap is critical to help them start and sustain their green journey - a key objective of this study. Through collective action and a coordinated ecosystem approach, we can lower barriers and build a compelling business case for SMEs to take action. At PwC, we see sustainability as an opportunity for growth and resilience, and we're proud to collaborate with Gprnt on this meaningful study.\" From insights to collective action Following from these recommendations, Gprnt, SBF and SA will engage with partners across the public and private sectors to study the feasibility of implementing these initiatives, to translate the Barometer's insights into tangible outcomes for SMEs and the wider economy. \"SMEs lack manpower, technical and financial resources for net zero transition. In today's tough economic climate, sustainability can easily take a back seat. The SME Sustainability Barometer is a timely reminder on where SMEs stand and where support is most needed. It calls for stronger public-private partnerships, and for Queen Bees to drive sustainability by integrating environmental considerations into purchasing decisions to drive positive change across their supply chain,\" said Kok Ping Soon, Chief Executive Officer of SBF. \"SMEs need to consider decarbonisation as an investment to reduce costs through utilities savings and gain new business by fulfilling demand for sustainable products/services. SBF is committed to help SMEs translate sustainability from aspiration to action, for meaningful and lasting business impact.\" Frank Phuan, Chief Executive Officer of Equator Renewables Asia and Co-Chair of SA said: \"The Sustainability Alliance supports the call for closer collaboration and collective action to help SMEs go green. Together with Gprnt and SBF, we invite trade associations and partners across the ecosystem to pool resources and co-create sustainability solutions that achieve economies of scale for SMEs and help them begin their green journeys.\" Access the 2025 SME Sustainability Barometer here: https://www.gprnt.ai/resources/smesustainabilitybarometer View the full media release here: https://www.gprnt.ai/newsroom/sme-sustainability-barometer About Gprnt Gprnt is a digital platform for sustainability disclosures and granular, verifiable ESG data.
