In 2025, the program introduced a series of new and expanded partnerships across banking, travel and lifestyle sectors, strengthening its promise to make earning and using points easier, more relevant and more rewarding for members worldwide. Radisson Rewards These new partnerships not only broaden everyday earning opportunities but also simplify points conversion and deliver added value through exclusive benefits. As Radisson Hotel Group's global portfolio continues to grow, now spanning more than 1,600 hotels including member favourite resorts and city hotels, members now have more cities than ever to redeem their rewards in. Strengthening financial partnerships across key markets As part of Radisson Rewards' expansion strategy across high-growth regions, including the UK, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, the program has significantly broadened its global banking network in 2025. These partnerships form part of a broader expansion strategy in Radisson Hotel Group high growth markets of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and India and they enable clients to seamlessly convert points from the bank's own loyalty program into Radisson Rewards points. As the largest bank in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, Al Rajhi Bank joins Radisson Hotel Group as a significant new partner, marking a major milestone in the Group's expansion across the Kingdom. This momentum is further strengthened by a new partnership with HSBC Bank in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Together with AI-enabled meetings and events solutions and culturally tailored F&B concepts, these initiatives deepen Radisson Hotel Group's connection with guests and loyalty members throughout the region. The Group has achieved record growth in India, recording 33 new hotel signings and expanding into 11 new cities in 2025. It has now partnered with HDFC Bank, India's largest private sector bank, and Axis Bank, the third-largest private sector bank in India, to offer guests and clients unrivalled access to hotels and rewards. In the United Kingdom, Radisson Hotel Group formed a new partnership with business credit card provider Capital on Tap, offering their PRO customers an exclusive tier match. This grants them immediate VIP status to utilize within Radisson Rewards. As part of this collaboration, all Capital on Tap bank customers can also seamlessly convert points earned through the bank's loyalty program directly into Radisson Rewards points, creating a streamlined path to enhanced travel benefits and rewards. Everyday rewards through lifestyle partnerships In an exciting expansion, the new Radisson Rewards Shop introduces a powerful new way for members to accelerate their earnings, uniquely positioning Radisson Rewards as a lifestyle ecosystem rather than a travel\u2010only program by allowing members to earn points on everyday purchases while shopping with their favourite brands. Brands in the portal include lifestyle favourites like Fnac, Sephora, Adidas, Nike, Apple, and Samsung. This elevated proposition makes Radisson Rewards stand out turning routine shopping into a rewarding experience that strengthens long\u2010term loyalty and keeps the brand present in members' everyday lives. Radisson Rewards Shop is currently available in the UK, US, India, Spain, France, Italy and Germany. Further strengthening its travel ecosystem, Radisson Rewards has extended its partnership with GetYourGuide, a booking platform for travel tours, attractions, excursions and activities around the world. Radisson Rewards members in all markets are now able to earn points per every US dollar spent in every market worldwide \u2013 enabling them more experiences, and more rewards. Radisson Rewards offers one of the sector's most streamlined tier structures, enabling members to reach the highest tier twice as fast as traditional hotel loyalty programs, with benefits available from day one. Combined with dynamic redemption and an expanding partner ecosystem, members enjoy greater flexibility and more meaningful ways to earn points and redeem them for exceptional experiences across the more than 1600 hotels. \"These partnerships reflect our commitment to expanding Radisson Rewards beyond hotel stays and creating a truly global lifestyle program,\" said Ana Martinez de Velasco, Global Director, Radisson Rewards at Radisson Hotel Group \"By integrating with leading brands across banking, travel, and retail, we are giving our members more ways to earn, more ways to engage, and more reasons to stay loyal.\" Learn more about Radisson Rewards.
