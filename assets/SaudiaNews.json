By leveraging technological empowerment, the company has strengthened the \"safety net\" for power grid operations, injecting robust innovative momentum into the stable and secure operation of the power grid during the winter peak load period. Transmission line corridors feature complex and diverse environments, often spanning highways, railways, power lines of varying voltage levels, and tree-growing areas. The safe distance at these \"crossing points\" is crucial to ensuring the reliable operation of the power grid. Insufficient distances, exacerbated by external factors such as strong winds and high temperatures, can easily trigger discharges, short circuits, and other accidents. Minor incidents may lead to line tripping and regional power outages, while severe cases could spark wildfires, posing a serious threat to public safety. Previously, traditional inspections relied primarily on line patrol personnel using binoculars, rangefinders, and other tools for ground measurements. This approach not only suffered from low efficiency and high labor intensity but also frequently resulted in measurement errors due to topographical constraints, making it difficult to detect potential hidden hazards in a timely manner and leaving risks to grid safety. To fully address this industry challenge, the Transmission Operation and Maintenance Center of the company took proactive steps to innovate, actively introducing intelligent UAV inspection technology and initiating a smart transformation from \"human-based defense\" to \"technology-based defense\"\u2014a significant breakthrough in the field of power grid inspections. The UAVs deployed by the center are equipped with high-definition visible light cameras and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) devices. At the operation site, maintenance personnel only need to preset the flight path, and the UAV can independently complete a series of operations including takeoff and line patrol. Its high-precision positioning system works in tandem with LiDAR to instantly capture the 3D spatial coordinates of crossing points, generating high-definition point cloud models and orthophotos in real time. Through precise post-processing with professional software, the net distance between any two points can be calculated with centimeter-level accuracy, marking a qualitative leap compared to traditional measurement methods. With technological innovation as its core, the Transmission Operation and Maintenance Center has driven the transformation of power grid inspection models. Utilizing innovative technologies, the center has completed inspections of 442.28 kilometers of key transmission corridors, accurately identified, and successfully addressed 7 potential safety hazards related to insufficient crossing distances. These achievements fully demonstrate the practical effectiveness of technological innovation in power grid operation and maintenance.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["uti", "oil", "cpr", "eut"], "creator": null, "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top", "technology"], "pubDate": "2025-11-20 04:29:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 4111305, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/en_prnasisa.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "68e046d861edb7ce18305787d25053bb", "link": "https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/656702/World/Europe/Russian-spy-ship-enters-UK-waters-aims-lasers-at-military-pilots?format=simple&link=link", "title": "Russian spy ship enters UK waters, aims lasers at RAF pilots", "description": "LONDON \u2014 A Russian spy ship has used lasers for the first time to disrupt RAF pilots tracking its activity near UK waters, the country's defense secretary has said.John Healey told reporters the", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["world"], "creator": ["saudigazette"], "language": "english", "country": ["saudi arabia"], "category": ["top", "politics", "crime"], "pubDate": "2025-11-20 04:27:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2025/11/20/2617760.jpg", "video_url": null, "source_id": "saudigazette", "source_name": "Saudi Gazette", "source_priority": 356263, "source_url": "https://saudigazette.com.sa", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/saudigazette.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "1d4c89e877fac7e787698de80cf849c6", "link": "https://en.prnasia.com/story/512784-0.shtml", "title": "Power \"Warmth\" Supports Enterprises Through Winter Peak Demand", "description": "JINCHANG, China, Nov. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- \"Today, all the factory's equipment can finally start up at the same time\u2014we no longer have to worry about power supply!\" On November 9th, Yang Shuguo, electrical contact person of Jinchang Bengxin Wangda Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd., expressed his gratitude to State Grid Jinchang Power Supply Company at the company's workshop. As the winter peak electricity demand approaches, a timely and efficient line maintenance has reassured this high-load power-consuming enterprise. The 08 feeder of Branch 118 on State Grid's 126 Jinwu Line, like a \"power artery,\" supplies developmental momentum to multiple small and medium-sized enterprises along its route. Among them, Jinchang Bengxin Wangda Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd. has extremely high requirements for power supply stability\u2014any disruption could impact production schedules. \"Winter power load keeps rising, so we must take preventive measures,\" noted a relevant person in charge of State Grid Jinchang Power Supply Company. During winter equipment inspections, the company detected potential safety hazards on the line and immediately launched an emergency response: dispatching key operation and maintenance personnel to form a special maintenance team, formulating detailed plans, and clarifying work divisions and safety requirements. A race-against-time \"power guarantee campaign\" quietly unfolded. At the maintenance site, bitter cold failed to dampen the staff's enthusiasm. They strictly followed standardized procedures\u2014patrolling lines, testing equipment, eliminating defects\u2014each step executed with meticulous care. Targeting critical issues such as aging user boundary switches, the maintenance team implemented precise optimizations and adjustments to ensure equipment operates in \"peak condition.\" This maintenance is not only an emergency measure to eliminate hazards but also a microcosm of State Grid Jinchang Power Supply Company's special \"Winter Peak Support\" initiative. The company continuously enhances its quality services: on one hand, accelerating power grid upgrading and renovation while conducting regular inspections and maintenance; on the other hand, streamlining repair channels and launching \"one-stop\" services including electricity consultation, connection applications, and fault reporting, making power use more convenient for enterprises. The tenet of \"Electricity for the People\" has transformed into tangible warmth in the cold winter. As the hum of machinery echoes again in Jinchang Bengxin Wangda's workshops and stable electric current flows to thousands of households, this dedicated power team has injected strong vitality into local economic development with their sense of responsibility and commitment\u2014making this winter warm and cozy, powered by reliable electricity.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS",
