Held over two days, 8-9 July, the summit was themed \"Powering social innovation with digital transformation\", and brought together more than 300 leading scholars, industry leaders, and policy experts from over 90 universities and 140 organisations worldwide. Participants looked at how emerging technologies, and particularly artificial intelligence (AI), can transform teaching and learning, and promote sustainability and social progress. Opening Ceremony of the THE Digital Universities Asia 2025 Summit. (From left: Prof Raymond Chan Hon-fu, Vice-President (Academics) cum Provost of Lingnan University, Mr Andrew Yao Cho-fai, Council Chairman, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, Secretary for Education, Prof S. Joe Qin, President of Lingnan University, Ms Lim Mei-mei, THE President for APAC) Driving digital transformation on campus, Lingnan also held the opening ceremony of the Lingnan HPC NexT Data Centre and hosted its inaugural High-Performance Computing (HPC) Week. The week-long programme featured expert instructors from the NVIDIA AI Technology Center (Hong Kong), who provided students and faculty with hands-on experience in applying AI and HPC technologies in education and research. Officiating guests included Dr Choi Yuk-lin, Secretary for Education, Ms Lim Mei-mei, THE President for APAC, Mr Andrew Yao Cho-fai, Council Chairman of Lingnan University, and Prof S. Joe Qin, President and Wai Kee Kau Chair Professor of Data Science of Lingnan University, and Prof Raymond Chan Hon-fu, Vice-President (Academics) cum Provost and Lam Man Tsan Chair Professor of Scientific Computing. \"The integration of digital tools and innovative techniques into traditional teaching methods is reshaping education. The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has been actively pursuing policies and initiatives that aim to revolutionise teaching, learning and research, ensuring that the younger generation is well-equipped to navigate the complexities in the era of exponential technology. The challenges we face are not confined by borders but are shared globally, requiring a collective effort from governments, policymakers, educators, and communities alike. We will work with all to create an educational environment that not only adapts to the digital age but also empowers and includes every member of our future generations,\" the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, said. Ms Lim Mei-mei, THE President for APAC, said that Lingnan University shows how tradition and technology can work together to transform lives. Lingnan's liberal arts foundation is placing students and communities at its core, and using bold digital innovation to deliver real-world impact. Its top performance in the SDG 4 Quality Education of the THE Impact Rankings highlights its leadership in inclusive and accessible education. Mr Andrew Yao Cho-fai, Council Chairman of Lingnan University said \"Today marks a significant milestone in the University's journey to becoming a leading hub for data science, research, and innovation. Lingnan HPC NexT is a testament to our commitment to harnessing cutting-edge technology to advance research and learning. It comes just in time to equip our students with the resources to explore innovative research in community problems, fostering leaders and innovators who can guide Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area to a more data-informed future,\" and that, in line with its strategic plan, the University established the School of Data Science (SDS) last year, integrating AI, computer science, the digital arts, and business to offer high-quality programmes from bachelor's degrees to PhDs. In his speech, Prof S. Joe Qin, President and Wai Kee Kau Chair Professor of Data Science at Lingnan University, pointed out that the summit's theme aligned with Lingnan's recent strategic emphasis on AI and digital transformation in higher education. \"This summit and its associated events offer valuable opportunities for our students and staff to gain first-hand experience in emerging technologies, understand their application potential in education and research better, and accelerate knowledge transfer. Lingnan plays an increasingly vital role in supporting Hong Kong's economic growth and driving industry transformation. Our constant efforts to promote community sustainability have also earned international recognition: Lingnan was placed No.1 globally for Quality Education (SDG 4) in the THE Impact Rankings 2025. We are the first higher education institution in Hong Kong to come first worldwide in any UN Sustainable Development Goal category, reinforcing Hong Kong's position as an international higher education hub.\" The summit's keynote speeches and panel discussions were led by representatives from leading universities across Hong Kong and Asia, who examined the far-reaching implications of digital transformation for the higher education sector and the public. The programme was based on four key themes: teaching, learning and assessment transformations; embracing the digital campus; enabling student success in the digital era; and digitally transforming the research experience. A main feature was the panel titled \"High performance computing for research and education,\" made up of Dr Simon See, Global Head of the NVIDIA AI Technology Center, and Lingnan scholars Prof Raymond Chan Hon-fu, Vice-President (Academics) cum Provost and Lam Man Tsan Chair Professor of Scientific Computing; Prof Sam Kwong Tak-wu, Associate Vice-President (Strategic Research) and J.K. Lee Chair Professor of Computational Intelligence; and Prof Li Jia, Associate Professor of the School of Interdisciplinary Studies. They discussed how HPC allows educators, researchers, and students to tackle complex interdisciplinary challenges in clean energy, finance, and the creative industries, and also addressed HPC's strengths in computational power, high-speed networks, and large-scale data storage, as well as its role in decision-making, problem-solving, and applied education. The panellists also emphasised the importance of critical thinking and human expertise in leveraging AI and HPC capabilities effectively. To encourage the use of HPC technologies within the Lingnan community and stimulate innovation in teaching and research through advanced computing, Lingnan's Information Technology Services Centre (ITSC) hosted the University's first HPC Week from 7\u201311 July. Expert instructors from the NVIDIA AI Technology Center (Hong Kong) were invited to conduct a personalised NVIDIA Boot Camp for Lingnan students, which provided an intensive introduction to HPC technologies, enabling them to master foundational concepts and tools. Participants then formed teams to develop AI agents using machine learning tools. Another high point of HPC Week was a Deep Learning Institute workshop, where students and faculty explored practical applications of AI and deep learning technologies. The workshop offered staff and students the opportunity to engage directly with industry experts, study the latest AI applications, and experience deep learning in action. Another technical workshop introduced them to the NVIDIA software platform and demonstrated best practices for GPU computing - a powerful method for handling large-scale data processing using graphics processing units, which strengthens research capabilities in data and AI model development.
