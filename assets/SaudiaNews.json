Since taking the reins, the duo has steered the network into a new era; one defined by tighter integration, emotionally-led creativity, and a sharpened focus on work that delivers both cultural impact and real business results. Chaka Sobhani commented: \"I literally don't have the words. This means the absolute world to us. I couldn't be prouder of our DDB network and the passion, commitment, and love that has gone behind us getting here. A huge thank you also to our amazing clients for their trust and partnership - we wouldn't be here without you and I hope we've made you proud. Hopefully, this is the start of much more to come from DDB - and on a personal note, I can only say it's been the most incredible first year!\" \"2023 was a landmark year for DDB, but we saw it as the beginning,\" said Alex Lubar. \"The momentum you're seeing now is the result of a global network aligned around a simple belief: creativity is the most powerful force in business.
