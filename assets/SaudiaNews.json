In this exclusive interview, Dr. Djalal, who has been deeply engaged in regional affairs for over two decades, shared his insights on how Asian countries are navigating today's changing global landscape, the enduring relevance of the Bandung Spirit, and the prospects for South-South cooperation under the BRICS mechanism. Dr. Djalal has long been committed to fostering friendly relations between ASEAN and China, as well as between Indonesia and China. He has played a key role in organizing and participating in various ASEAN-China exchanges. Each year, he leads the FPCI China Forum, which brings together scholars and experts from ASEAN and China to discuss evolving dynamics, opportunities, and challenges in ASEAN-China and Indonesia-China relations. In September 2023, he was honoured with the Friendship Envoy Award at the Inaugural Orchid Award. COA: In recent years, China and ASEAN countries have been continuously promoting consultations on the text of the Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea, and has completed its third reading. What do you think is the next step for the negotiation of the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea? Dino Patti Jalal: We have to recognize that we're living in a more dangerous world now. The value of the COC would be to tell the world that while in other places, war is raging and mistrust is rising, but in the South China Sea, we are working on a code of conduct that would enhance confidence building among the claimants and among countries in the region. And that code of conduct will be, we hope, will be finalized. And that would be a really significant achievement in the relations between ASEAN and China. The target is for next year, 2026. My hope is that they will be able to finalize the code of conduct in time by 2026. But if the positions are still too wide and they cannot reach an agreement, then I guess we need to find more time to conclude the code of conduct. COA: This year marks the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and Indonesia\u2014a historic milestone in bilateral relations. As a long-time observer and participant in China-Indonesia relations, how do you assess the development of this partnership and its future prospects? Dr. Dino Patti Djalal: China is one of Indonesia's best strategic partners now. The two countries now enjoy a comprehensive and strategic partnership. The relationship, as you said, has been around for many decades. And I think we are at a high point in our relationship. The trust is high, China is the biggest trading partner. The people-to-people contact is also very strong. And China's investment in Indonesia keeps rising. When we see the future of Indonesia, the future of the region, the future of Asia Pacific, China is a very big part of it. Right? So constructive, positive relationship between Indonesia and China is very important to us. We've done many polls at my institution in Jakarta. And in every poll that we ask Indonesians and also ASEAN people, they all recognize that China is the most impactful country to their region. So overall, I think the relationship is in a good place, and I think it's one of the pillars of peace in Asia. COA: Seventy years ago, the Bandung Conference was held, marking a historic moment of solidarity and cooperation among Asian and African nations. How can we best carry forward the Bandung Spirit in today's complex international landscape? Dr. Dino Patti Djalal: Bandung is very historic. It changed world affairs when it began in 1955. China was there from the start, and we appreciate it. And I think both Indonesia and China have come a long way since the Bandung Conference. We are a lot richer, a lot stronger. We are a lot more confident. We have a lot more roles in international affairs. And at the same time, Asia and Africa have changed as well for the better. So I think we have much to celebrate for the 70th Bandung celebration. The spirit of Bandung should remain very much alive, especially because today there's the United States is having a retreat and unilateralism, and confidence in multilateralism is decreasing. I think the countries in the global south, the countries of Asia and Africa, have much to do to uphold multilateralism and to uphold the rules-based world order. COA: Earlier this year, Indonesia was officially been admitted as a full member of the BRICS. What impact does this have on China-Indonesia cooperation and Indonesia's role in South-South cooperation? Dr. Dino Patti Djalal: Indonesia's accession to BRICS undoubtedly adds value to the cooperation. Even before joining BRICS, Indonesia and China have had a really outstanding, close relationship, very vibrant, very substantive and very high and strategic trust between the two countries. Now that Indonesia has joined BRICS, we're still learning how to perform in that association in that grouping. Indonesia is learning how to work with other BRICS countries and also the incoming members to improve the state of the world. Because we want BRICS to be a contributor, a contributor to world peace, and we want to depolarize the world now. We want there to be more cooperation, and we want to be playing a bridge-building role in that regard here. COA: Given the current evolving political ecology in the United States, what are its potential implications for the peaceful resolution of South China Sea disputes? Dr. Dino Patti Djalal: The situation remains unpredictable, as American policy can be difficult to forecast. We are still awaiting clarity on President Trump's approach to Asia, especially in comparison to his policies toward Europe, Canada, Mexico, or Latin America. But we are still waiting for what he wants to do concerning the Asia Pacific. Importantly, ASEAN has a guiding doctrine known as the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP), which China has endorsed. The AOIP promotes a vision for the Indo-Pacific as a region that is free, open, cooperative, and inclusive. Instead, ASEAN advocates for inclusive regional cooperation characterised by mutual respect and equality among all players. We hope that the United States will adopt a constructive policy toward the region and support the AOIP, which emphasises cooperation and inclusiveness. China is undoubtedly one of ASEAN's strongest partners, and the content of our relationship is rich, encompassing both governmental and people-to-people cooperation. I believe China respects the ASEAN Charter and is a signatory to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, being the first country outside ASEAN to do so. As a dialogue partner, China actively participates in various ASEAN initiatives, contributing to a rich relationship that is a cornerstone of stability in Asia. I am optimistic about this partnership; it must be resilient so that when challenges arise\u2014as they undoubtedly will\u2014the relationship remains strong and capable of addressing any issues. For this to happen, both sides must cultivate mutual trust and engage as equals. ASEAN has consistently emphasised its centrality in regional affairs. It plays a central role in managing affairs in this region, and China understands and supports this. Together, we can work towards peace and stability in our region.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-04-22 06:35:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "video_url":
