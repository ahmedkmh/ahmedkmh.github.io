Grants In-Principle Approval for India's First GIFT City IPO", "description": "MUMBAI, India, Jan. 23, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- XED, a globally integrated executive education enterprise, has received in-principle approval from NSE International Exchange (NSE IX) for its proposed initial public offering of USD 12 million at GIFT City, marking a significant milestone in the company's journey toward becoming one of the first Indian enterprises to list under India's international financial services framework. This development represents the second key regulatory milestone following the submission of the Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) and moves XED closer to its proposed public listing at GIFT City \u2014 India's International Financial Services Centre regulated by the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA). \"The in-principle approval from NSE IX is an important validation of the institutional foundation we have built over the years,\" said John Kallelil, Founder and Managing Director, XED. \"As we progress toward becoming a publicly listed company, our focus remains on governance, transparency, and long-term value creation. GIFT City provides a framework that aligns well with our global footprint and our aspiration to operate to international standards.\" XED's Strategic Fit with the GIFT City Framework XED's decision to pursue a GIFT City listing aligns closely with the company's global operating model and long-term institutional vision. Over the past decade, XED has built a leadership and executive education ecosystem serving senior professionals across 25+ countries, with operational presence spanning India, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and North America. The company collaborates with some of the world's most respected academic institutions, including the Sai\u0308d Business School, University of Oxford, Cornell University, University of Michigan Ross School of Business, University of Virginia Darden School of Business, Indian School of Business (ISB), and Carnegie Mellon University, among others. Rather than following the rapid-scale approach traditionally associated with the education technology sector, XED has pursued a measured, governance-led growth strategy, prioritising institutional credibility, global relevance, and long-term sustainability. \"GIFT City represents India's next chapter as a global financial hub,\" said Piyush Agrawal, CFO, XED. \"Its dollar-denominated framework provides global investors a frictionless, transparent route to participate in India's growth story. For XED, this approval is not just regulatory progress \u2014 it is validation of our readiness to operate as a publicly accountable global institution.\" \"This transaction is a watershed moment \u2014 both for XED and for GIFT City,\" said Abhishek Kaushik, CEO of Global Horizons, merchant banker to the issue. \"We see XED as a category-defining issuer for this platform: a globally aligned, governance-driven company accessing investors in a dollar-denominated, tax-efficient, and regulation-light environment. It showcases how India can offer Nasdaq-style access to Indian enterprises without losing regulatory discipline.\" Backed by Long-Term Institutional and Entrepreneurial Capital XED's journey has been supported by a diverse group of investors with deep operating and global market experience. The company's shareholders include Ecosystem Ventures, an established angel investment platform, as well as family offices of prominent entrepreneurs and business leaders. These include the family office of Kunal Shah, founder of CRED; the family office of Pratekk Agarwaal, former Chief Business Officer at BharatPe; and the family office of Pavan Bakeri, Managing Director of the Bakeri Group. The company is also backed by senior finance leaders with extensive international experience. GIFT CITY \u2014 A New Gateway for Global and NRI Investors The in-principle approval by NSE IX is a critical step in the listing process and reflects the growing maturity of India's offshore capital market ecosystem. GIFT City has been envisioned as India's global financial gateway \u2014 enabling Indian companies with international operations to access overseas capital while remaining within an Indian regulatory framework. For Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and global investors, the GIFT City platform offers a fundamentally different investment experience compared to traditional domestic listings. Under the IFSCA framework, eligible investors are able to participate in offerings through a dollar-denominated structure, allowing investments and exits in foreign currency without exposure to Indian rupee volatility.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["fin", "eco", "cpr", "fnt", "pdt"], "creator": null, "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["business", "top"], "datatype": "news", "pubDate": "2026-01-23 01:00:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "fetched_at": "2026-01-23 02:05:43", "image_url": "https://mma.prnasia.com/media2/2754480/5730601/XED_Logo.jpg?p=medium600", "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 4111305, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/en_prnasisa.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": true}, {"article_id": "2bb1f60106ebed383bb9d824bef15a82", "link": "https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Trump-Claims-UK-Has-500-Years-Of-Oil-Reserves-Left-In-The-North-Sea.html", "title": "Trump Claims UK Has 500 Years Of Oil Reserves Left In The North Sea", "description": "The U.S. stock market has pared back heavy losses it posted earlier in the week after U.S. President Donald Trump relented on his threat to slap European and NATO nations with tariffs for opposing his push to acquire Greenland.

Sigenergy Ranked No. 1 Energy Storage Brand in Australia, Ireland, and South Africa Across these markets, SunWiz data confirms Sigenergy's market leadership in energy storage system market share by total installed capacity across the 0\u20131000 kWh range, reflecting broad installer adoption and strong customer preference. In Australia, Ireland, and South Africa, Sigenergy is the most widely selected energy storage brand among installers, reinforcing its position as a leading supplier in both mature and fast-growing energy markets. In addition, Sigenergy has maintained its position as the No. 1 battery manufacturer in Australia by blended capacity[1] since March 2025. Based on SunWiz data, the company has held this top ranking for ten consecutive months, underscoring sustained market leadership rather than a short-term surge. Sigenergy's strong regional performance reflects a consistent global growth trajectory. On a worldwide basis, Frost & Sullivan has ranked Sigenergy No. 1 in the stackable all-in-one Distributed Energy Storage System category. In 2024, Sigenergy shipped 475 MWh in this segment, capturing a 28.6 percent share of the global market.

This comprised AUD1.25 billion five-year Fixed-Rate Note (FXD) and AUD750 million five-year Floating-Rate Note (FRN) tranches, which were priced on 21 January at the three-month Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW) plus 0.72%. Pricing: Relative Value versus Australian Major Banks and Regional Peers Priced 2 basis points (bps) inside of the most recent Australian Major Bank 5Y Senior (CBA: +74 bp vs UOB: +72 bp) Priced flat to an Australian major bank 5Y senior unsecured new issue in today's market, representing no new issue concession UOB leveraged one of the flattest 3-5yr tenor of 13 bps today vs. a peak of 28 bps in the post-Covid era Price the tightest 5Y A$ bank senior unsecured transaction globally since UOB's own A$ 5Y in November 2021 Priced flat to 1 bp tighter vs. UOB US$ 5Y Senior, which was also more impacted by headlines vs. the more defensive nature of the AUD bond market Investor Demand This transaction demonstrates our continued engagement with AUD investors. UOB has raised two AUD2 billion transactions across both 2025 and 2026, with a domestic investor allocation of approximately 55% UOB offered both floating and fixed rate tranches to maximise investor participation given strong investor demand for 5-year notes due to the higher spread and yield offered amidst the multi-year tight spread environment This trade also captured robust fund managers, corporations and official institutions demand, at 58% for the fixed rate tranche and 29% for the floating rate tranche. 58% for the fixed rate tranche is one of the highest real money participations in AUD bond offerings from non-domestic banks This strong investor interest resulted in UOB being able to print the largest non-domestic 5Y fixed rate tranche The transaction was announced on 20 January (Tuesday), and the strong combined orderbooks of >AUD3.38 bn overnight gave UOB the confidence to launch the transaction on 21 January (Wednesday) Ms Koh Chin Chin, Head of Group Treasury, Research and Customer Advocacy, UOB, said, \"We are happy to have offered investors relative value through our choice in tenor whilst achieving our objectives in both size and pricing, and are very pleased to have seen the continued strong support from the investor community despite global markets sentiment softening this week.\" Transaction Statistics Achieved the largest peak orderbook of
