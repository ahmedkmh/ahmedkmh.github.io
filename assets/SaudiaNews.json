Gozellix\u00ae, after radiolabeling with 68Ga, is indicated for PET scanning of PSMA positive lesions in men with prostate cancer who have suspected metastasis and are candidates for initial definitive therapy, and those with suspected recurrence based on elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. Gozellix\u00ae is a novel product which provides a longer shelf life of up to six hours and an extended distribution radius compared to existing gallium-based imaging products. The ability to reliably deliver the product much further from its point of production means Gozellix\u00ae can reach PET cameras that are currently not served by any PSMA imaging providers, bringing the accuracy and clinical utility of gallium-based imaging to more patients across the U.S. The innovative formulation, which allows for more scalable production, also has the potential to enhance the efficiency, scheduling flexibility and throughput of scanning clinics. Gozellix\u00ae builds on the success of Telix's established PSMA-PET imaging agent, Illuccix\u00ae, and will be available alongside the first-generation product, providing choice for customers and patients based on their individual needs. In the U.S., the accuracy and sensitivity of PSMA-PET imaging means it has become the standard of care for prostate cancer imaging after initial diagnosis and biochemical recurrence[2]. However, only a relatively small fraction of the 3.4 million men living with prostate cancer in the U.S. have undergone this type of precision medicine scan[3],[4]. Telix believes Gozellix\u00ae will help to address these access issues, as it is expected to be eligible for full reimbursement[5] with reduced or no patient co-insurance, meaning it can reach more patients, particularly in underserved populations. Kevin Richardson, Chief Executive Officer, Telix Precision Medicine, said, \"Securing FDA approval for Gozellix is a major win for prostate cancer patients, who gain enhanced access to state-of-the-art 68Ga PSMA-PET imaging. Telix continues to invest in innovation across our portfolio, and Gozellix is a testament to this continuous improvement approach. With the launch of Gozellix, our team is excited to be bringing the new generation of prostate cancer scanning to more American men, delivered with the reliability, service and flexibility that customers have come to expect from Telix.\" IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk for Misinterpretation Image interpretation errors can occur with GOZELLIX PET. A negative image does not rule out the presence of prostate cancer, and a positive image does not confirm the presence of prostate cancer. Gallium Ga-68 gozetotide uptake is not specific for prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer as well as non-malignant processes such as Paget's disease, fibrous dysplasia, and osteophytosis. Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological evaluation of the suspected prostate cancer site, is recommended. Imaging Prior to Initial Definitive or Suspected Recurrence Therapy The performance of GOZELLIX for imaging of biochemically recurrent prostate cancer seems to be affected by serum PSA levels and by site of disease. The performance of GOZELLIX for imaging of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes prior to initial definitive therapy seems to be affected by Gleason score. Radiation Risks Gallium Ga-68 gozetotide contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk for cancer. Ensure safe handling to minimize radiation exposure to the patient and healthcare providers. Advise patients to hydrate before and after administration and to void frequently after administration. Hypersensitivity Reactions to Sulfites Ascorbic Acid Stabilizer contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people. ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety of gallium Ga-68 gozetotide was evaluated in 960 patients in the PSMA-PreRP and PSMABCR studies, each receiving one dose of gallium Ga-68 gozetotide. The average injected activity was 188.7 \u00b1 40.7 MBq (5.1 \u00b1 1.1 mCi). The most commonly reported adverse reactions were nausea, diarrhea, and dizziness, occurring at a rate of DRUG INTERACTIONS Androgen deprivation therapy and other therapies targeting the androgen pathway Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and other therapies targeting the androgen pathway, such as androgen receptor antagonists, can result in changes in uptake of gallium Ga-68 gozetotide in prostate cancer. The effect of these therapies on performance of gallium Ga-68 gozetotide PET has not been established. Please note that this information is not comprehensive.

the Water Excellence Stewardship (WES) program to advance UN Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6) Contributing to the 2025 World Water Day campaign to ensure the availability of water and sanitation for all SHANGHAI, March 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- WuXi Biologics (\"WuXi Bio\") (2269.HK), a leading global Contract Research, Development, and Manufacturing Organization (CRDMO), today announced it has been recognized by the environmental non-profit CDP for leadership in corporate transparency and performance on water security, securing a place on the organization's annual \"A List\" for the second year. According to CDP's scoring methodology, companies are evaluated on their awareness of environmental issues, management methods and advancements in environmental stewardship. Assessments are conducted across four levels that represent the steps a company moves through on its action journey: Disclosure (D-/D score), Awareness (C-/C score), Management (B-/B score), Leadership (A/A- score). Based on data reported through the CDP 2024 Assessment Questionnaire, WuXi Biologics achieved a score of \"A\" for Water Security, standing out among over 25,000 companies evaluated. As a contributor to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6), WuXi Biologics has adopted a systematic approach to enhance environment-friendly water management and help ensure the availability of water and sanitation for all. Various proactive measures regarding water are employed: measuring, avoiding, reducing and recycling. The company has set a target to reduce water consumption intensity by 30% by 2025 from the base year 2019.
