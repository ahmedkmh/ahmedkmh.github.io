Continued strong price/mix contribution, driven by pricing actions and active portfolio management, as well as good cost control which largely offset the lower volumes and currency headwind.Adjusted operating margin: 11.9% (11.5%)Net cash flow from operations: SEK 3,576 million (3,435) Rickard Gustafson, President and CEO: \"We are pleased to report a continued solid margin development, representing a year-over-year improvement, despite declining volumes in the prevailing weak market environment and significant currency headwinds. We continue our strategic execution creating an even stronger SKF, with the initiated separation of our Automotive business as a key component.\" Solid margin and strong cash flow The weak market conditions prevailed globally during the third quarter, which also was reflected in multiple leading external macro indicators. Our organic sales declined by -4.4%, driven in particular by a weak demand in China and within Automotive, especially towards the end of the quarter. On the other hand, our sales in India and within Aerospace were solid. Our adjusted operating margin, on the other hand, improved year-over-year and came in just shy of 12%, another proof point of our ability to better adapt to volatile market conditions. Our cost management and robust price/mix actions have effectively offset lower sales volumes, a significant negative currency impact and ongoing regionalization of our manufacturing footprint. We continue to work hard on cost out activities to mitigate potential short-term impact on our cost efficiency from the current lower volume environment. Our ability to uphold solid earnings also contributed to a strong cash flow from operations of SEK 3.6 billion. Unlocking value by separating the Automotive business The announced initiated separation of our Automotive segment follows our strategy to create a separate Automotive business. There is a strong strategic rationale for the separation since Industrial and Automotive are two business segments with different business logics. By establishing two fit-for-purpose independent companies, we expect to unlock long-term value and to accelerate profitable growth in both businesses. Since the announcement of the separation in mid-September, we have kick-started the separation planning and formed a dedicated project organization with the aim of listing the Automotive business in the first half of 2026. We intend to host a Capital Markets Day in Q4 2025 to share more information on the ambitions for both our Industrial and Automotive businesses. Strategic portfolio management to build a stronger SKF We continue to actively work with our portfolio to create a more focused and resilient SKF. I'm pleased that we have signed a contract to divest our ring and seal operation in Hanover, USA, which is a non-strategic asset for our Aerospace business, representing annual sales of approximately SEK 700 million, for a total value of approximately SEK 2.3 billion. Aerospace will remain one of our largest customer industries, representing total annual sales of approximately SEK 6 billion, corresponding to 9% of industrial net sales after the divestment. We will continue to invest and strengthen our position in core Aerospace segments related to the aeroengine and aerostructure bearing offers to optimize our business potential. With our strategy and decentralized operating model being well implemented, we are now in a position to also gradually accelerate profitable growth through smaller bolt-on acquisitions. As an example, the announced acquisition of John Sample Group is margin accretive and further strengthens our lubrication offering and position in the expansive India and Southeast Asia region. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our employees for their contributions to achieving solid margin and strong cash flow, despite the weak demand environment, and a continued high pace in our strategic execution. Outlook We expect to see continued market and geopolitical volatility, and the business is prepared to tackle different scenarios. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect a mid-single-digit organic sales decline, year-over-year. For the full year, we expect a mid-single-digit organic sales decline, compared to 2023.\" Financial overview, MSEK unless otherwise stated Q3 2024 Q3 2023 Jan-Sep 2024 Jan-Sep 2023 Net sales 23,692 25,771 73,997 79,443 Organic growth, % \u22124.4 \u22120.6 \u22126.1 5.7 Adjusted operating profit 2,821 2,956 9,448 10,049 Adjusted operating margin, % 11.9 11.5 12.8 12.6 Operating profit 2,526 2,567 8,008 9,159 Operating margin, % 10.7 10.0 10.8 11.5 Adjusted profit before taxes 2,536 2,582 8,515 8,855 Profit before taxes 2,241 2,193 7,075 7,965 Net cash flow from operating activities 3,576 3,435 7,509 9,846 Basic earnings per share 3.40 3.64 10.91 12.67 Adjusted earnings per share 4.05 4.49 14.07 14.62 Net sales, change y-o-y, %, Q3 Organic1) Structure Currency Total SKF Group \u22124.4 0.0 \u22123.6 \u22128.0 Industrial \u22124.6 0.0 \u22123.7 \u22128.3 Automotive \u22124.0 0.0 \u22123.5 \u22127.5 1) Price, mix and volume Net sales, change y-o-y, %, Jan-Sep 2024 Organic1) Structure Currency Total SKF Group \u22126.1 0.0 \u22120.8 \u22126.9 Industrial \u22126.5 0.1 \u22120.9 \u22127.3 Automotive \u22125.1 0.0 \u22120.8 \u22125.9 1) Price, mix and volume Organic sales in local currencies, change y-o-y, %, Q3 Europe, Middle East & Africa The Americas China & Northeast Asia India & Southeast Asia SKF Group \u22125.2 \u22122.9 \u22128.7 2.9 Industrial - +/- --- + Automotive --- - +/- + Organic sales in local currencies, change y-o-y, %, Jan-Sep 2024 Europe, Middle East & Africa The Americas China & Northeast Asia India & Southeast Asia SKF Group \u22125.5 \u22126.1 \u221210.8 1.5 Industrial -- -- --- +/- Automotive --- -- +/- ++ Outlook and Guidance Outlook Q4 2024: We expect a mid-single-digit organic sales decline, year-over-year.

Compared with the previous use of video surveillance means for macro monitoring of the security environment in the station, the intelligent patrol system through high-precision video acquisition equipment, focusing on transformers, circuit breakers, isolation switches and other key equipment in the substation. In addition, the intelligent patrol system can collect equipment appearance status, oil temperature, gas pressure value and other important production and operation data in real time, and upload it to the main station host in the region in time for centralized storage and automatic analysis. It is worth mentioning that the intelligent patrol system also integrates advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, which can automatically identify equipment defects, as well as potential alarms such as equipment overheating, oil level anomalies, and gas leaks, to achieve unmanned automatic patrol. Through this move, not only greatly improve the inspection efficiency, but also significantly enhance the accuracy and timeliness of defect detection, and provide a strong guarantee for the safe and stable operation of the substation. It is estimated that in the trial operation stage, the efficiency of the intelligent patrol system is 50% higher than that of the traditional manual patrol. At present, it is the autumn maintenance peak of the power grid.

So we have only one place in this universe. This is our planet Earth,\" he stated. Peace, he emphasized, is another critical component. \"If there is war, if there is political instability, can you continue to do business? Can people continue to receive education? How can we live a peaceful life? We must have peace,\" Ban Ki-moon said. He also discussed the significance of partnerships for prosperity. Ban Ki-moon sees ESG as a vital partnership model, one where good governance inspires political leaders to foster collaboration among business, government, and society. \"We have to join all our hands together. We must make sure that future generation, our young people should be able to live in peace, harmony, and in good health. This is what we have to do. That's our moral responsibility,\" he said, expressing his hope that future generations will be free from suffering, poverty, and preventable diseases, and will have equal access to education. Ban Ki-moon also highlighted gender equality, calling for fair opportunities for women: \"There must be an equal right and privileges and opportunities for women. That's what I did at the United Nations. I just wanted to make sure that women should be given equal opportunities politically, socially, economically, whatever equal like a man.\" Turning to China, Ban Ki-moon acknowledged the country's influence, vast resources, and role in sustainable development. He praised the Belt and Road Initiative as \"visionary,\" expressing his hope that China will fulfill its ambitious goals. He noted China's progress towards high-quality, low-energy consumption development as a model of sustainable and inclusive growth, serving as an example for the world. Ban Ki-moon also commended China's commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, underscoring that such efforts prove ambitious climate goals are within reach and necessary for a cleaner future. He concluded with a call to action, urging global cooperation to create a sustainable world, protect our planet, and secure a better future for generations to come. Additionally, During the conference, Ban Ki-moon presented a gift of ginseng to Cai Lei, a renowned ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) fighter, serial entrepreneur, and former Vice President of JD.com. Due to health reasons, Cai Lei could not attend the conference in person, so his wife, Duan Rui, accepted the gift on his behalf. In return, Duan Rui presented Ban Ki-moon with a piece of traditional Chinese porcelain, symbolizing Chinese culture. Cai Lei shared his regret online for being unable to meet Ban Ki-moon in person, referencing an earlier live video conversation they had in January during the \"China Economic Newsmakers and Entrepreneurs Night.\" He expressed how Ban Ki-moon's attention to the ALS cause was both inspiring and encouraging for him and other ALS patients. He went on to thank Ban Ki-moon for his advocacy efforts with governments, research institutions, medical facilities, and charities worldwide, which have helped Cai's team build broader international collaborations. Cai Lei also announced that he and his wife had donated an additional 100 million yuan earlier this year to support ALS-related research, drug development, and clinical treatment. He expressed hope for future collaboration with the Ban Ki-moon Centre and other international institutions, aiming to accelerate drug development and clinical trials to bring life-saving treatments to the 500,000 ALS patients and 300 million rare disease patients worldwide.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2024-10-30 06:26:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://mma.prnasia.com/media2/2541482/image_984982_9279204.jpg?p=medium600", "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_priority": 1333464, "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/en_prnasisa.png", "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top"], "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": true}, {"article_id": "ac2839ac3109ece29478585d45a9931d", "title": "\"\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0654\u0633 \u0645\u062f\u0641\u0648\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062c\u062b\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\".. \u063a\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u062c\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0655\u0633\u0631\u0627\u064a\u0654\u064a\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u063a\u0632\u0629 \u062a\u0642\u062a\u0644 \u0627\u0654\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0645\u0646 90 \u0634\u062e\u0635\u064b\u0627", "link": "https://arabic.cnn.com/middle-east/video/2024/10/30/v164560-israel-airstrike-northern-gaza-ldn-digvid", "keywords": ["\u0628\u064a\u062a \u0644\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0627", "\u0627\u0644\u062c\u064a\u0634 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644\u064a", "\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a -
