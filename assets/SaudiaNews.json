Mr. Hui Xu, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Texxon, commented: \"We are pleased to report strong results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025. To align with evolving market conditions and the broader industry environment, we implemented a strategic shift in our sales and marketing efforts toward high-growth sectors such as automotive, new energy, and chemical industries. Leveraging our core strengths in basic chemicals and plastic particles, we expanded our sales team to further broaden our customer base, market coverage, and penetration across China.\" \"The refinement of our basic chemical product portfolio contributed to an improved average selling price. Our plastic particle sales surged as sales volume increased in response to increased demand, driven by their expanded application in new fields such as automotive, new energy and chemical industries, despite a decline in selling prices. Collectively, these initiatives drove an 18.5% increase in overall revenue, highlighted by an 88.5% surge in plastic-particle sales, while basic-chemical sales slightly grew 1.5%.\" \"We prioritized business scale and long-term customer relationships over short-term margin gains. While this strategy temporarily compressed gross margin and profit, we believe it will strengthen customer retention, stabilize cash flows, and support sustainable profitability over the long term.\" \"We are accelerating the construction of a factory to manufacture polystyrene, including production lines, storage facilities, and supporting infrastructure, located in Henan Province, China (the \"Henan Polystyrene Factory\"), which is scheduled to begin production in the fourth quarter of 2025. Once operational, we expect it will enable us to better meet market demand and capture higher margins amid potential shortages in chemical and plastic raw materials.\" \"Looking ahead, we remain committed to achieving profitable growth through enhanced operational efficiency, deeper customer relationships, and disciplined product portfolio and pricing strategies. We believe, these initiatives will support long-term shareholder value and position Texxon for continued growth in an increasingly dynamic market.\" Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Summary Revenue was $797.15 million for fiscal year 2025, representing an increase of 18.5% from $672.66 million for fiscal year 2024. Gross profit was $4.70 million for fiscal year 2025, compared to $4.82 million for fiscal year 2024. Gross profit margin was 0.6% for fiscal year 2025, compared to 0.7% for fiscal year 2024. Net loss was $1.45 million for fiscal year 2025, compared to net income of $2.51 million for fiscal year 2024. Net loss attributable to Texxon was $0.93 million for fiscal year 2025, compared to net income attributable to Texxon of $0.95 million for fiscal year 2024. Basic and diluted losses per share were $0.05 for fiscal year 2025, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.05 for fiscal year 2024. Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results Revenue Revenue was $797.15 million for fiscal year 2025, representing an increase of 18.5% from $672.66 million for fiscal year 2024. (($ millions, except for percentages) For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, Change In million 2025 % 2024 % $ % Revenue: Basic chemicals $ 524.64 65.8 % $ 517.03 76.9 % $ 7.61 1.5 % Plastic particles 272.39 34.2 % 144.50 21.5 % 127.89 88.5 % Other products 0.12 0.0 % 11.13 1.6 % (11.02) (98.9) % Total revenue $ 797.15 100 % $ 672.66 100 % $ 124.49 18.5 % Sales of basic chemicals were $524.64 million for fiscal year 2025, representing an increase of 1.5% from $517.03 million for fiscal year 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average sales price. Sales of plastic particles were $272.39 million for fiscal year 2025, representing an increase of 88.5% from $144.50 million for fiscal year 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volume. Sales of other products were $0.12 million for fiscal year 2025, compared to $11.13 million for fiscal year 2024. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to no sales of black metal for the fiscal year 2025, which had contributed approximately $11.0 million revenue from sales of other products for the fiscal year 2024. Cost of Sales Cost of sales was $792.45 million for fiscal year 2025, representing an increase of 18.7% from $667.85 million for fiscal year 2024. The increase in cost of sales was largely attributable to the increase in the Company's sales volume of plastic particles by approximately 188.7 thousand tons, or 138.3%. The increase in cost of sales is in line with the increase in revenue. Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin Gross profit was $4.70 million for fiscal year 2025, compared to $4.82 million for fiscal year 2024. Gross profit margin was 0.6% for fiscal year 2025, compared to 0.7% for fiscal year 2024. Gross profit and gross margin decreased primarily due to the Company's strategic shift toward serving major customers, to whom the Company offered more competitive pricing. The Company prioritized expanding business scale and strengthening long-term customer relationships over pursuing short-term high-margin transactions. This strategy temporarily reduced gross margin but is expected to enhance customer retention, stabilize cash flows, and support sustainable profitability growth in the long term. Operating Expenses Operating expenses were $5.30 million for fiscal year 2025, representing an increase of 27.5% from $4.16 million for fiscal year 2024. Selling expenses were $2.41 million for fiscal year 2025, representing an increase of 21.2% from $1.99 million for fiscal year 2024. The increase in selling expenses was mainly due to (i) salary and welfare benefit expenses increased by approximately $0.3 million mainly due to the addition of marketing personnel to support the Company's business expansion and higher commissions and bonuses paid to sales staff in connection with the increase in sales; (ii) shipping and delivery expenses increased by approximately $0.1 million, or 7.2%, from approximately $1.0 million for the fiscal year 2024 to approximately $1.1 million for the fiscal year 2025. This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales volume and increased use of third-party shipping services for the sale of plastic particles. The total sales volume of plastic particles increased by 189 thousand tons, or 138.8%, from 136.0 thousand tons for the fiscal year 2024 to 324.8 thousand tons for the fiscal year 2025. General and administrative expenses were $2.89 million for fiscal year 2025, representing an increase of 33.3% from $2.17 million for fiscal year 2024. The increase was mainly due to (i) an expected credit loss of approximately $0.7 million for the fiscal year 2025, compared to $1,385 of credit loss recovered for the fiscal year 2024, primarily due to full credit losses established against specific customer receivables following assessment of credit deterioration; and (ii) an increase in salary and welfare benefit expenses of approximately $0.1 million due to an increase in personnel in general and administrative department, (iii) an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $0.1 million, partially offset by (iv) a decrease in professional services fee of approximately $0.2 million. Other expenses were $1.37 million for fiscal year 2025, compared to other income of $2.57 million for fiscal year 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to one-time government grants of approximately $2.9 million received in connection with the construction of Henan Polystyrene Factory, which are recognized as a reduction of the cost of construction in progress rather than as other income. Net Income (loss) Net loss was $1.45 million for fiscal year 2025, compared to net income of $2.51 million for fiscal year 2024. Net loss attributable to Texxon was $0.93 million for fiscal year 2025, compared to net income attributable to Texxon of $0.95 million for fiscal year 2024. Basic and Diluted Earnings (losses) per Share Basic and diluted losses per share were $0.05 for fiscal year 2025, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.05 for fiscal year 2024. Financial Condition As of June 30, 2025, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $2.52 million, an increase from $0.27 million as of June 30, 2024. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.32 million for fiscal year 2025, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $30.80 million for fiscal year 2024. Net cash used in investing activities was $42.25 million for fiscal year 2025, compared to $11.02 million for fiscal year 2024.
