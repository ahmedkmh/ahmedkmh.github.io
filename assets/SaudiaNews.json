The funding will support Decube's global growth, continued product innovation, and rapid expansion across the APAC region, as enterprises increasingly look to operationalize AI on top of data they can trust. The Context Data Layer Enterprises Need As organizations invest heavily in AI, many are discovering a hard truth: AI systems are only as effective as the context provided to them. While enterprises have modern data platforms, warehouses, and pipelines, they often lack a unified way to explain what their data actually means, where it comes from, how it changes, and whether it should be trusted. Decube is building what many enterprises are missing: a context layer for data. In practical terms, Decube sits between raw data systems and AI or analytics use cases, providing the critical context required for responsible and scalable decision-making. This includes understanding lineage, ownership, quality, and usage policies\u2014without relying on manual documentation or disconnected tools. For business and data leaders, this context layer becomes the foundation that allows AI initiatives to move from experimentation to production with confidence. Commenting on the success of this latest funding round, Jatin Solanki, Founder and CEO of Decube said: \"Decube was founded on a simple insight: enterprises can't scale AI without a trusted context layer across their data. This round validates what we are seeing at the heart of almost every large business: enterprises are racing to deploy AI, but most are still missing the context layer that makes AI reliable at an enterprise level. This funding allows us to move faster, expand strategically across APAC, and help our clients turn trusted data into production-grade AI, not experiments. We are building the foundation that lets AI actually work in the real world.\" With this funding, Decube plans to deepen its global footprint while expanding rapidly across the APAC region, where enterprises are modernizing data estates and preparing for AI at scale. The company will invest in product capabilities, regional partnerships, and enterprise deployments aligned with this growing demand. The Missing Foundation Behind Enterprise AI Adoption Decube's platform helps enterprises move beyond fragmented metadata, spreadsheets, and tribal knowledge by unifying data understanding into a single system. This enables organizations to: Know where data originates and how it is transformed Establish accountability and ownership across data assets Continuously assess data reliability before it is consumed Provide trusted, explainable inputs to analytics and AI systems This approach is increasingly critical for regulated and data-intensive industries, where AI adoption must balance speed, trust, and accountability. Reflecting on the funding opportunity, Tawania Hive Co-Founder and Managing Partner Yan Lee said: \"We were drawn to Decube because of the clarity of the problem they are solving and the strength of the team executing against it. As AI adoption moves from pilots to core enterprise systems, the need for scalable, production-grade data foundations is becoming non-negotiable. Decube is building a category-defining platform with strong early traction in regulated industries, and we are excited to support the company as it scales across Asia Pacific.\" Decube is already supporting enterprises across highly regulated industries including regional banks, financial institutions, telcos, and global corporates. In Indonesia, PT Superbank, which recently went public, is using Decube as part of its AI foundation to ensure that the data powering analytics and AI is governed, traceable, and ready for production use. This reflects a broader shift among Chief Data Officers: moving from isolated governance initiatives toward operational data trust embedded directly into data workflows. *With this round Decube completes 5 million in total funding. Other investors include Orvel Ventures and First Move Fund. About Decube Decube provides the trusted data context that AI and analytics depend on. It provides enterprises with a unified layer to understand, trust, and operationalize their data\u2014bringing together lineage, metadata, quality signals, and controls into a single foundation. Decube enables organizations to build analytics and AI systems on data that is not just available, but explainable and trustworthy.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["ven",

Asia's Largest Single-Turbine Nearshore Wind Projects", "description": "HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Jan. 30, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Envision Energy, a global leader in green technology, has signed a turbine supply contract with Vietnam's REE Group for a whole 128MW nearshore wind projects in Vinh Long Province, which includes V1-3 Phase II 48 MW and V1-5&6 Phase II 80MW. The two projects will deploy sixteen(16) units EN-226/8.XMW offshore wind turbines and will become the nearshore wind projects with the largest single-turbine capacity in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, supporting the country's net-zero ambitions. These two projects will start construction simultaneously, with average wind speeds exceeding 7 meters per second. It is among the first batches projects approved under Vietnam's Power Development Plan VIII (PDP VIII) and marks a milestone as the first to adopt large-rotor, high-capacity offshore turbines in the country. Full grid connection is expected by October 2026. Envision Energy applies true offshore wind standards to meet Vietnam's high-humidity and high-salt-spray conditions, ensuring turbine performance, reliability, EHS compliance, and localization requirements, while safeguarding project quality and more than 20 years of operational value of REE as the investor. Envision has also collaborated with local tower suppliers and project owners to overcome challenges in large offshore turbine tower manufacturing and local production capacity. Since its launch in 2022, the EN-226/8.XMW turbine has secured over 2.5GW in orders, becoming the most successful model in public tenders for low-wind-speed offshore regions. It has been deployed at scale and operated stably for over three years in Chinese offshore projects. Edward Hou, Senior Vice President & President of Asia-Pacific at Envision Energy said: \"This collaboration marks the first nearshore offshore wind project cluster delivered under Vietnam's Power Development Plan VIII and opens a new chapter for offshore wind development in Southeast Asia. Envision is committed to delivering this project as a regional benchmark, providing strategic support for REE Group's energy transition, while offering replicable technical and construction references for nearshore and far-offshore wind projects across the region, driving the energy system toward a net-zero future.\" \"We selected Envision Energy as our turbine supplier based on their technological leadership in renewable energy, the maturity and reliability of the EN-226/8.XMW platform, and their extensive experience in gigawatt-scale grid-connected operations. We are confident that this project will set a benchmark for offshore wind in Vietnam and provide replicable technical and construction references for nearshore and offshore wind development across Southeast Asia.\" added Mr. Ashok, REE Renewable General Manager.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["uti", "oil", "lic", "env", "gre", "alt"], "creator": null, "language":

Bangkok", "description": "BANGKOK, Jan. 30, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Knoll brought its enduring design philosophy to Bangkok with an intimate evening of conversation and exchange, bringing together leaders from Thailand's architecture and design community to explore the lasting relevance of Florence Knoll's concept of Total Design. Hosted in Bangkok and presented in partnership with Pergo, part of CHANINTR Group, the event examined how Florence Knoll's multidisciplinary approach, integrating furniture, architecture, textiles, and space planning, continues to influence contemporary practice across workplaces, hospitality, and public environments. A distinguished panel of design leaders shared their perspectives on Knoll's design legacy and its relevance within today's global and regional context: - Ms Sarinrath Kamolratanapiboon, CEO, DWP - Ms Theeranuj Karnasuta Wongwaisayawan, Managing Director, IA49 - Mr Chanintr Sirisant, CEO, CHANINTR - Alexandra Ramundi, Workplace Strategist, MillerKnoll Moderated by Jeremy Smart, editor-in-chief of Design Anthology and an internationally respected design commentator, the discussion explored how Florence Knoll's Total Design philosophy remains a powerful framework for creating cohesive, human-centred environments. From Knoll's modernist foundations to the realities of contemporary practice in Southeast Asia, the conversation highlighted design as both a cultural and strategic force. Reflecting on the partnership and local relevance of the event, Chanintr Sirisant, CEO, CHANINTR, said: \"Knoll's approach to design has always been grounded in clarity, purpose, and integrity, values that strongly resonate within the Thai design community. Hosting this conversation in Bangkok allowed us to connect global design thinking with local practice, and to explore how Total Design continues to inform meaningful, long-lasting environments today.\" The panel also reflected on sustainability, longevity, and the value of specifying enduring design, themes that strongly resonate in the Thai market, where craftsmanship, materiality, and thoughtful reuse are increasingly central to architectural discourse. Praveen Muppidi, Senior Regional Director, South Asia & South East Asia, MillerKnoll, added: \"Southeast Asia is an increasingly important region for the MillerKnoll collective, and Thailand plays a key role in that growth. Bringing Knoll's Total Design philosophy into conversation with local designers is not about introducing something new, but about reconnecting with principles that continue to shape thoughtful, human-centred design across markets.\" The event brought together architects, interior designers, and industry leaders for an evening of insight, dialogue, and connection, set against a curated presentation of Knoll's iconic modernist and contemporary pieces. As Knoll continues to expand its presence across Southeast Asia, events such as this underscore the brand's commitment to engaging local design communities and reinforcing its role as a leader in modern architectural design.
