BALI, Indonesia, May 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The 2025 Asia Grassroots Forum hosted by Amartha in collaboration with Accion, Women's World Banking and Maj Invest concluded today in Bali. Themed \"Scaling Impact, Pioneering an Entrepreneurial Society,\" the event brought together over 700 investors, policymakers, changemakers, and innovators from more than 15 countries to spotlight the potential of Asia's grassroots economy. Eka Sri, Balinese milk custard tart seller serving customers at The 2025 Asia Grassroots Forum event, Bali (22/5). This forum brought the women-led micro enterprises as the testament of the grassroots economy that holds immense untapped possibilities. \"The grassroots economy holds immense untapped possibilities in ASEAN and the Global South,\" said Amartha Founder and CEO Andi Taufan Garuda Putra. \"We know this from our experience at Amartha, empowering over 3.3 million rural borrowers in Indonesia over the past 15 years. Together with our partners and the delegates here today, it is inspiring to see that so many stakeholders, including global players, are increasingly aware and willing to take action.\" According to the 2024 Impact Investing in Asia Report, global investors are increasing their focus to Southeast Asia, with 49 percent planning to expand their allocations throughout 2025. The report also reported that 89 percent of Asia-focused impact investors surveyed reported that their financial returns were outperforming or performing in line with expectation.[1] Over a full day of dynamic discussions among thought leaders, policymakers, investors, startups, NGOs, innovators and academics, participants explored how to catalyze bottom-up growth, along with its opportunities and challenges. Speakers at the 2025 Asia Grassroots Investments included impact investing representatives from Accion, Women World's Banking, Maj Invest, BEENEXT, LeapFrog, Abler Nordic, UOB Venture Management and Teja Ventures, as well as global banks such as Standard Chartered and Deutsche Bank. Also in attendance were policymakers, venture capital firms, BNI Ventures, Mandiri Capital Indonesia, microfinance, fintechs, academics, changemakers and innovators, and more. Njord Andrewes, Managing Partner, Accion Digital Transformation, said, \"Companies like Amartha are unlocking the potential of the grassroots economy in a sustainable way, showing that serving this segment can deliver social impact and financial returns. With small businesses vital for the continued growth of emerging markets, there is now global interest in the potential of the grassroots economy. We are partnering with Amartha to provide both strategic support and growth capital, as they connect businesses across Indonesia to responsible financial services for the first time using digital technologies.\" Within the ASEAN grassroots economy, MSMEs make up 97% of the private sector, contributing to 85% of the labor force, 45% of regional GDP, and 10\u201330% of exports.[2] However, many MSMEs In emerging economies and developing countries still face significant barriers, the more so for women. For example, women-owned businesses in these areas face an $1.9 trillion financing gap, highlighting the significant barriers women entrepreneurs face in accessing financing.[3] Sanjay Sehgal, Managing Director & CIO of Women's World Banking noted, \"We believe gender-lens investment is essential to promoting inclusive growth. Partnering with organizations like Amartha, which shares our commitment to reaching women in underserved rural areas, allows us to design and scale solutions that are truly inclusive. By embedding gender-intentional strategies into financial services, we can close the gender gap and build more resilient, equitable economies for all\". Addressing this gap, Amartha's success in using tech to serve rural female micro-entrepreneurs at scale has attracted the support of global institutional investors including IFC, Women's World Banking, Accion, Community Investment Management, and many more. \"The aim of the 2025 Asia Grassroots Forum is to build interest and cross-sector partnership from investors and other stakeholders, including policymakers and innovators, to harness technology and capital towards inclusive growth for all,\" finished Taufan.

Minimally Invasive, Incisionless Treatment KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, May 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Pantai Hospital Kuala Lumpur (PHKL) proudly celebrates a major milestone in its endoscopic journey, having successfully performed 50 Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM) procedures since the service was introduced in 2020. This achievement highlights the hospital's growing leadership in advanced, minimally invasive gastrointestinal treatments. Dr Lau Peng Choong, our Consultant Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery, with his first successful POEM patient in 2020\u2014marking PHKL as the first private hospital in Malaysia to perform the procedure. The POEM procedures are led by Dr. Lau Peng Choong, Consultant Upper Gastrointestinal (GI) Surgeon at PHKL. POEM is a cutting-edge, incisionless procedure used to treat achalasia, a rare disorder that affects the ability of the oesophagus to move food into the stomach. \"We're proud to reach this milestone of 50 POEM cases,\" said Dr. Lau. \"This treatment has significantly improved the quality of life for patients with achalasia\u2014a condition that's often misdiagnosed as acid reflux or anxiety. With POEM, we can now offer an effective, minimally invasive solution with quicker recovery and less discomfort.\" Unlike traditional or even laparoscopic surgeries, POEM is performed entirely using an endoscope passed through the mouth. The technique involves cutting the muscles at the lower end of the oesophagus to allow smoother passage of food, offering faster recovery times, less pain, and lower complication risks. Expanding the Scope of Endoscopic Expertise In addition to POEM, Dr. Lau Peng Choong, Consultant Upper GI Surgeon, and Dr. Gew Lai Teck, Consultant Gastroenterologist & Hepatologist, have successfully performed Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) for close to 20 patients with Stage 1 gastrointestinal cancers, eliminating the need for minimally invasive or open surgery. ESD is a highly precise procedure that allows for the removal of complex growths\u2014such as early cancers or large polyps\u2014from the gastrointestinal tract without external incisions. Both specialists are extensively trained in advanced endoscopic interventions, and their expertise is supported by a dedicated multidisciplinary team, ensuring that patients receive seamless, collaborative, and comprehensive care. \"With the recent introduction of Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty (ESG), we're further broadening our scope of minimally invasive treatment options,\" shared Dr. Lau. \"From cancer treatment to obesity management and digestive disorders, we're committed to helping patients heal faster, feel better, and return to daily life sooner.\" PHKL is now offering ESG procedures at an introductory rate of RM25,000, making it an accessible solution for patients considering effective weight management treatments. The procedure is performed by Dr Lau Peng Choong, Consultant Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeon, and Dr Gew Lai Teck, Consultant Gastroenterologist\u2014both trained and experienced in advanced endoscopic techniques.
