What began in 1925 with voluntary vehicle inspections is now a global expert organization for safety, sustainability, and digital trust. On its centennial, DEKRA reaffirms its commitment to tackling the major challenges of our time \u2013 in line with its anniversary motto: \"Securing the Future.\" DEKRA was founded on June 30, 1925, in Berlin as the \"Deutscher Kraftfahrzeug-U\u0308berwachungs-Verein\" (German Motor Vehicle Inspection Association) \u2013 at a time when the automobile was beginning to reshape the world. Its mission: voluntary technical inspections to bring safety to a new era of mobility. A century later, this initiative has evolved into a global expert organization with 48,000 employees in around 60 countries \u2013 all pursuing one clear goal: enabling safety and trust in a changing world. What began in 1925 with vehicle inspections has grown into a comprehensive portfolio across mobility, industry, environment, and digital technologies. DEKRA tests both physical and digital products, processes, and systems. \"Safety is not static \u2013 it evolves with the world we live in,\" says CEO Stan Zurkiewicz. \"Our task is to help shape key areas of transformation \u2013 mobility, digitalization, artificial intelligence, and sustainability \u2013 with expertise, responsibility, and foresight.\" Shaping Germany \u2013 Expanding Globally DEKRA's history is marked by constant progress. When periodic vehicle inspections became mandatory in Germany in 1951, DEKRA played a key role in their implementation. The 1960s and 1970s brought a focus on education and research, including the founding of DEKRA Akademie (1974), the Research and Development department (1968), and Accident Research (1978) \u2013 the latter with the aim of learning from data. After German reunification, DEKRA took over responsibilities from the former East German vehicle authority and built a comprehensive inspection network in the new federal states. Shortly thereafter, the company entered international markets, including France, Spain, China, and the United States. Since then, DEKRA has pursued a globally focused strategy \u2013 while maintaining strong roots in its home market of Germany. New Fields \u2013 Same Mission: Safety in Transition Starting in the mid-2000s, DEKRA systematically expanded its competencies in industrial inspection, infrastructure, and environmental technologies \u2013 with the founding of DEKRA Industrial GmbH as a major milestone. In 2017, the acquisition of the Lausitzring racetrack in Brandenburg, Germany, marked an important step toward future mobility. Together with the neighboring DEKRA Technology Center, it now forms Europe's largest independent test center for automated and connected driving \u2013 a symbol of mobility transformation and the safe, responsible implementation of new technologies. Today, DEKRA's scope ranges from AI validation and cybersecurity to hydrogen safety and sustainability certifications. The common thread remains: building trust where transformation happens. Testing Expertise for Tomorrow's World \"Digitalization, connected systems, and artificial intelligence are increasingly shaping our everyday lives \u2013 at home, on the road, and in the workplace. To fully harness their potential and drive innovation, we must understand their risks and manage them effectively. Only then can we truly trust them,\" says Petra Finke, Chief Digitalization Officer at DEKRA. \"Safety is the foundation for that trust. That's why we've developed an integrated testing approach that combines functional safety, cybersecurity, and AI validation.\" DEKRA bundles these services under the term Digital Trust Services. This means the organization doesn't just assess whether software or systems function properly and pose no danger to users \u2013 it also examines whether they are resilient against cyberattacks, transparent in their decision-making logic, and ethically sound in their use of AI. \"At DEKRA, we view digitalization not only from a technical angle but also strategically \u2013 as a driver for more efficient processes, intelligently connected data, and new, trustworthy services, both internally and externally,\" Finke adds. Global Growth with Focus \u2013 People at the Center DEKRA is also expanding its geographical footprint in future-relevant markets. \"We are making targeted investments in regions where transformation is tangible \u2013 in Asia, North America, and Europe,\" says Peter Laursen, Chief Operating Officer for DEKRA's global regions. \"These are the places where new technologies, new industries, and new safety requirements are emerging. And we want to help shape that future \u2013 not just respond to it.\" At the same time, DEKRA's operational backbone \u2013 such as vehicle inspection, industrial inspection, product testing, and audits \u2013 remains central. \"These are our core services, where we also see great growth potential,\" Laursen continues. However, sustainable growth in new markets requires more than technology \u2013 it needs people who understand and drive change. \"The future is not decided by technology alone \u2013 but by people who use it responsibly,\" emphasizes Chief Financial Officer and Head of Human Resources Wolfgang Linsenmaier. \"That's why we are consistently investing in employee development, strengthening leadership, and fostering digital skills at all levels.\" DEKRA is also modernizing internal structures \u2013 with clearer career paths, more efficient systems, and a globally connected HR approach. The goal: a learning, values-based organization with strong customer focus. UNICEF Partnership: Securing Water Means Securing the Future As part of its centennial, DEKRA is also breaking new ground in social responsibility \u2013 through a partnership with UNICEF for the Water Security for All initiative. Together, the two organizations are implementing programs to provide access to clean drinking water in regions highly affected by climate change \u2013 including solar-powered water pumps, technical training centers, and modern groundwater treatment. \"Water is essential for life \u2013 and increasingly scarce,\" says CEO Zurkiewicz. \"Our partnership with UNICEF demonstrates what 'Securing the Future' means to us: the future begins with responsibility \u2013 for products and systems, but above all, for people.\" The centennial is being celebrated in Berlin, DEKRA's founding location, with partners from business, politics, and society. About DEKRA For 100 years, DEKRA has been a trusted name in safety. Founded in 1925 with the original goal of improving road safety through vehicle inspections, DEKRA has grown to become the world's largest independent, non-listed expert organization in the field of testing, inspection, and certification. Today, as a global partner, the company supports its customers with comprehensive services and solutions to drive safety and sustainability forward\u2014fully aligned with DEKRA's anniversary motto, \"Securing the Future.\" In 2024, DEKRA generated revenue of 4.3 billion euros. Around 48,000 employees are providing qualified and independent expert services in approximately 60 countries across five continents. DEKRA holds a Platinum rating from EcoVadis, placing it among the top 1% of the world's most sustainable companies.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-07-09 01:00:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://mma.prnasia.com/media2/2399413/DEKRA_logo_Logo.jpg?p=medium600", "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 1333464, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/en_prnasisa.png", "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top"], "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": true}, {"article_id": "04c362a1a9e8383087ab8d219bc9c38e", "title": "NTT TechnoCross Receives Frost & Sullivan's 2025 Japan Company of the Year Recognition for Leadership in Privileged Access Management", "link": "https://en.prnasia.com/story/495888-0.shtml", "keywords": ["cpr", "stw", "hts", "awd"], "creator": null, "description": "The company is recognized for pioneering innovation and customer-centric security solutions in the PAM industry SAN ANTONIO, July 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Frost & Sullivan is pleased to announce that NTT TechnoCross Corporation has been awarded the 2025 Japan Company of the Year Recognition in the privileged access management (PAM) industry for its outstanding achievements in cybersecurity innovation, strategic execution, and ability to deliver measurable value to enterprise clients.
