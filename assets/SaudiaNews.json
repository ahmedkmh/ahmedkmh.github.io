(\"Innovent\") (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, and commercializes high-quality medicines for the treatment of oncology, autoimmune, cardiovascular and metabolic, ophthalmology and other major disease areas, announced the initial data of the first-in-human trial of IBI3003, a novel trispecific antibody targeting G protein-coupled receptor C5D (GPRC5D), B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), and CD3 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM), in an oral presentation at the 2025 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. IBI3003 demonstrated favorable tolerability and a manageable safety profile. Despite the relatively short follow-up duration, IBI3003 has shown encouraging efficacy signals, particularly in high-risk patients with extramedullary disease (EMD) or those who have previously received anti-BCMA and/or anti-GPRC5D targeted therapies. IBI3003 is a novel trispecific antibody targeting GPRC5D, BCMA and CD3 simultaneously. Its dual-targeting design against BCMA and GPRC5 aims to overcome single antigen escape in multiple myeloma (MM). In preclinical studies, IBI3003 exhibited superior in vivo anti-tumor activity over marketed benchmark bispecific antibodies in mouse models, with particularly prominent tumor-killing efficacy in in vitro cell models with low expression of BCMA and GPRC5D. Currently, Innovent is conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT06083207) of IBI3003 in China and Australia to evaluate its safety, tolerability, and efficacy in patients with R/R MM. The first phase of the study enrolled eligible R/R MM patients who had failed \u22652 lines of previous anti-myeloma therapies that included at least a proteasome inhibitor (PI), an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), and an anti-CD38 mAb; and must be relapsed or refractory to their last anti-myeloma regimen. Prior BCMA- or GPRC5D-targeting therapy was allowed. IBI3003 was administered subcutaneously once weekly (QW). For patients who have received continuous treatment for \u22656 months and achieved partial response (PR) or better for \u22652 months could switch to Q2W as maintenance. To reduce the risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), 1 to 3 priming doses were included in the study design. A total of 39 patients were enrolled in this phase in China and Australia, with a dose range of 0.1 \u03bcg/kg to 800 \u03bcg/kg. The median age of patients was 62 years (range: 40-79), 64.1% of whom were classified as high-risk per mSMART criteria, and 46.2% had \u22651 EMD. The median number of prior lines of therapy was 4 (range: 1-10). All patients had received at least three classes of drugs (PI, IMiD, and anti-CD38 antibody), 51.3% had received at least five classes of drugs (at least 2 PIs, 2 IMiDs, and 1 anti-CD38 antibody), 41% had previously received anti-BCMA and/or anti-GPRC5D therapies, and 76.9% were refractory to the last treatment. As of the data cutoff date, November 7, 2025, the median follow-up duration was 3.25 months (range: 0.4-7.4), and the median treatment duration was 12.14 weeks (range: 1.0-33.0). Manageable Safety Profile of IBI3003 in R/R MM Patients Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) only occurred in 2 patients, both of whom experienced Grade 4 platelet count decreased and recovered. 97.4% of patients experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Common TEAEs included CRS, neutrophil count decrease, anemia, lymphocyte count decrease, white blood cell count decrease, and platelet count decrease. Hematological disorders were the most common Grade \u22653 TEAEs that mainly occurred during step-up dosing and were manageable and recoverable. The incidences of CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were 64.1% and 6.1%, respectively, all of which were Grade 1-2 and resolved with treatment. Prophylactic use of tocilizumab may reduce incidence, severity, and duration CRS. The incidence of all-grade infections was 48.7%, with Grade \u22653 infections reported in 28.2% of patients. For GPRC5D target-related TEAEs involving the oral cavity, skin, and nails, no Grade \u22653 oral TEAEs were observed. Most skin and nail TEAEs were Grade 1-2, with only 2 patients experiencing Grade 3 rash. Encouraging Efficacy and Depth of Response Observed with IBI3003 at Doses \u2265120 \u03bcg/kg Encouraging efficacy was observed with a median follow-up of 3.25 months: Among patients treated with \u2265120 \u03bcg/kg (n=24), the overall response rate (ORR) was 83.3%, including 4 cases of stringent complete response (sCR), 7 cases of very good partial response (VGPR), and 9 cases of partial response (PR). Among patients treated with \u2265120 \u03bcg/kg, the ORR was 80% in 10 patients with EMD and 77.8% in 9 patients who had previously received anti-BCMA and/or anti-GPRC5D therapies. Among patients who achieved CR or better as assessed by central laboratory next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing, the minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate was 100% (n=4). Potent and Sustained Pharmacodynamic Responses Observed with IBI3003 in R/R MM Patients Biomarker analysis showed that baseline soluble BCMA (sBCMA) levels were high and variable in R/R MM patients (median level: 198 ng/mL, range: 10-3010 ng/mL). A profound and durable decline in serum sBCMA across 120, 360 and 540 \u03bcg/kg groups was observed, demonstrating a strong pharmacodynamic response. IBI3003 has demonstrated favorable tolerability and a manageable safety profile in R/R MM patients, with encouraging efficacy signals observed at doses \u2265120 \u03bcg/kg. Efficacy responses were also observed in high-risk patients, including those with EMD or prior anti-BCMA and/or anti-GPRC5D therapies. Current follow-up remains relatively short, and deeper anti-tumor responses are expected with continued treatment and observation. Dose optimization for IBI3003 is ongoing in the Phase 1 study. Professor Peng Liu, Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, stated, \"Patients with R/R MM have a poor prognosis after failing standard treatments, including PI, IMiD, and anti-CD38 therapies, with an ORR of only 29.8%, a median progression-free survival of 4.6 months, and a median overall survival of 12.4 months[1]. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet clinical need for these patients, particularly those with high-risk features such as EMD or prior anti-BCMA and/or anti-GPRC5D therapies. The dual-target coverage of BCMA and GPRC5D by IBI3003 addresses the issues of antigen expression heterogeneity and treatment resistance associated with single-target drugs, reducing tumor escape. Meanwhile, its optimized CD3 affinity enables precise T-cell activation for tumor killing while also improving safety. In the disclosed Phase 1 study results, IBI3003 showed a manageable safety profile and impressive efficacy data at doses \u2265120 \u03bcg/kg, with an ORR of 83.3%. It also demonstrated significant efficacy in high-risk patients with EMD or prior anti-BCMA and/or anti-GPRC5D therapies, fully reflecting its potential in overcoming R/R MM. We look forward to the long-term follow-up survival data with continuous IBI3003 treatment.\" About IBI3003 (Anti-GPRC5D/BCMA/CD3 Trispecific Antibody) IBI3003 is a tri-specific TCE developed using Innovent's proprietary Sanbody platform to target both GPRC5D and BCMA. Designed to overcome drug resistance driven by single-antigen tumor escape, IBI3003 has exhibited superior in vivo antitumor activity in preclinical studies compared with marketed benchmark TCEs, especially in cell models with low BCMA and GPRC5D expression.

At the awards ceremony for the 2025 Vietnam Scholarship Quiz Show sponsored by Daesang Group, winners pose for a commemorative photo. As part of its overseas social contribution initiatives, Daesang supports the Vietnam Scholarship Quiz Show to contribute to the improvement of local educational environments and the development of outstanding young talent. The \"Vietnam Scholarship Quiz Show\" (Vietnamese: Tra\u0323ng Nguye\u0302n tuo\u0302\u0309i 13) is a national academic competition for middle school students in grades 6\u20139 (ages 10\u201314). Students compete in history, geography, language, mathematics, and more using a traditional \"past exam\" style format. Rather than simple multiple-choice tests, the format includes oral discussions in which students' thinking and problem-solving abilities are evaluated comprehensively. This year's edition \u2014 with a total prize pool of 500 million VND \u2014 drew the largest turnout in the show's history, with over 100,000 participants nationwide. Among them, 100 finalists advanced to the final round after overcoming odds of roughly 1000:1. Ultimately, 15-year-old \u0110inh Ba\u0309o Kha\u0301nh from Cau Giay Middle School in Hanoi claimed first place and the scholarship prize of 200 million VND. Kha\u0301nh expressed gratitude, saying, \"I thank my parents for their support and Daesang Group for giving me this meaningful opportunity. I will never forget the joy of learning.\" This year's competition introduced a new format: the finalists were divided into teams to compete in a \"team quiz,\" testing not only academic knowledge but also cooperation and creative thinking. The judging panel, composed of prominent Vietnamese experts, and the show's host \u2014 broadcaster Khanh Vy, often called Vietnam's national MC \u2014 added both excitement and professionalism. As a result, the show achieved the highest prime-time viewership ratings on VTV3 for the fifth consecutive year, reaffirming its popularity. Mr. Jeon Chang-geun, Head of Daesang Vietnam, said: \"We consider it important to support youth learning and growth through scholarship programs grounded in the value of respect. Since last year, we have organized gatherings of past winners to foster networking, and we will continue to expand a variety of support initiatives to nurture future talent in Vietnam.\" Daesang first entered the Vietnamese market in 1994 by establishing its local subsidiary Miwon Vietnam (now Daesang Vietnam). Since then, the company has steadily expanded its business by offering products tailored to local tastes such as seasoning bases for soups, gim (seaweed), kimchi, and tteokbokki. In 2016, Daesang acquired Vietnamese meat-processing company Duc Viet Foods.

USD 460,000 for the Development of a Prototype Mpox Detection Test with NIPRO, TBA, Japan Institute for Health Security and others", "description": "TOKYO, Dec. 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Global Health Innovative Technology (GHIT) Fund announced today an investment of approximately JPY 70 million (USD 460,0001) for the development of a prototype detection test for mpox (formerly known as monkeypox2). Mpox is a viral infectious disease that has been spreading in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and across sub-Saharan Africa. According to a situation report by the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 170,000 cases of mpox were confirmed in 141 countries between January 2022 and October 20253. WHO also reported that surveillance data for the January-May 2024 period in DRC indicated that 62% of the fatalities occurred in children aged under 5 years, where the case fatality ratio in this age group ranged from approximately 7 to 9%4. Due to the sharp increase in cases, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) was declared again in August 2024 against the widespread outbreak in the African region, following the declaration made in July 2022. Although the emergency declaration was lifted in September 2025, mpox cases continue to be reported in neighboring countries, and the risk of severe complications and re-emergence remains a concern 5. Mpox is mainly classified into two strains/clades, and infection rates and disease severity vary depending on the type. Locally, diagnostic systems currently available for identifying the clades remain insufficient, and developing simple and rapid diagnostic tests with clade distinguishing capabilities is urgently needed to prevent the further spread of infection. Against this background, the GHIT Fund will invest approximately 70 million yen (USD 460,0001) in the development of a prototype mpox detection test. The project involves NIPRO CORPORATION, a global comprehensive healthcare company in the medical devices and pharmaceuticals; TBA Co., Ltd, a venture company originating from Tohoku University; the Japan Institute for Health Security (JIHS); the international non-profit organization PATH (USA); and the Institut National de Recherche Biome\u0301dicale (INRB). The project seeks to develop a prototype detection test capable of distinguishing clades using the Iso-PAS method\u2014an inexpensive and simple genetic testing technique\u2014and its performance will be evaluated. This will enable easy testing even in facilities with limited infrastructure, facilitating prompt and appropriate treatment while helping to prevent the spread of infection. The GHIT Fund joined the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R) 6 as a member in September 2025. GloPID-R brings together funders investing in research related to new or re-emerging infectious diseases. The GHIT Fund is the second organization from Japan to join GloPID-R as a member after the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED). We will continue to support the development of innovative diagnostic technologies to enable swift responses to future public health challenges. 1 USD1 = JPY154.10, the approximate exchange rate on October 31, 2025.2 Mpox was renamed from monkeypox by WHO in 2022https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2022-who-recommends-new-name-for-monkeypox-disease3 WHO: Global Mpox Trends. https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/ (Published on November 21, 2025)4 WHO: Disease Outbreak News Mox \u2013 Democratic Republic of the Congo https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON522 (Published on June 21, 2024)5 Africa CDC: https://africacdc.org/news-item/mpox-still-a-continental-emergency-africa-cdc-advisory-group-recommends/(Published on September 4)6 GloPID-R Secretariat receives funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation program.

Median overall survival not yet reached and is projected to exceed four years, which would surpass osimertinib monotherapy by more than one year. /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson today announced final overall survival (OS) results from the Asia patients of the Phase 3 MARIPOSA study. Head-to-head comparison data versus osimertinib monotherapy showed amivantamab plus lazertinib led to a clinically meaningful OS improvement in the first-line treatment of Asian patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions (ex19del) or L858R substitution mutations. Median OS for this chemotherapy-free regimen is projected to exceed four years, which would represent a more than one-year improvement compared to osimertinib alone. These results were presented during a proffered paper session at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Asia Congress 2025 (Abstract #972O).[1] \"Amivantamab plus lazertinib demonstrated a 26 percent lower risk of death compared to osimertinib monotherapy and is projected to extend survival well beyond what has historically been possible,\" said presenting author and lead trial investigator Dr. Hidetoshi Hayashi*, M.D., Ph.D., Department of Medical Oncology, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine in Osaka-Sakai, Japan. \"For patients in Asia, where EGFR-mutated disease is highly prevalent, these findings establish the combination as an important new treatment that advances the standard of care in the first-line setting.\" Asia has the largest population of patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 30 to 40 percent compared to 10 to 15 percent in Europe and the United States.[2] Despite treatment advances, approximately 30 percent of patients do not reach second-line therapy, making the choice of first treatment critical.[3] Fewer than 20 percent of patients are alive five years after diagnosis.[4] Results from 501 participants who self-identified as Asian in the MARIPOSA trial, showed those treated with amivantamab plus lazertinib had a 26 percent lower risk of death compared with osimertinib (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.97; nominal P=0.026), based on a median follow-up of 38.7 months. Median OS for the combination was not yet reached compared with 38.4 months for osimertinib (95 percent CI, 35.1-not reached). Survival projections suggest that amivantamab plus lazertinib could extend median OS to more than a year beyond that achieved with osimertinib. At three years, 61 percent of patients treated with the combination were alive compared with 53 percent of those receiving osimertinib. The survival advantage was maintained at 42 months, with survival rates of 59 percent and 46 percent, respectively, indicating a durable survival benefit with RYBREVANT + LAZCLUZE combination therapy in 1L. Secondary endpoints including disease progression in the brain and time to symptomatic progression were positive and consistent with results seen globally.[1] \"These results give real proof that progress is being made for people living with EGFR-mutated lung cancer,\" said Kazuo Hasegawa**, Founder of Lung Cancer Patients Network ONE STEP. \"For patients and families across Asia, where this disease is especially common, seeing survival extend beyond what once seemed possible brings hope for a different future.\" \"We're working to change the course of lung cancer by addressing its underlying biology,\" said Anthony Elgamal, Vice President of Oncology, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine Asia Pacific. \"By targeting the key EGFR and MET pathways that drive tumor growth and resistance while engaging the immune system, amivantamab plus lazertinib is delivering longer survival in the first-line setting and helping advance outcomes for patients across Asia.\" The safety profile of amivantamab plus lazertinib was consistent with the overall MARIPOSA population and prior reports in Asian patients. No new safety concerns were observed. Most adverse reactions occurred early in treatment and were manageable with appropriate care. Among Asian participants, the most common Grade 3 or higher adverse events were rash (18 percent), dermatitis acneiform (9 percent), and paronychia (9 percent).[1] Follow-up studies of amivantamab suggest that using preemptive or prophylactic measures can help lower the overall number and severity of skin reactions, infusion-related reactions, and venous thromboembolic events.[5,6,7,8] The combination of amivantamab and lazertinib is approved in the United States, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region in the Japan, China, Australia, Singapore, Korea and Taiwan market for first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC based on the global MARIPOSA Phase 3 study; additional markets in the Asia\u2010Pacific region are expected to follow shortly. About the MARIPOSA Asia Cohort The MARIPOSA Asia cohort is part of the global, randomized, Phase 3 MARIPOSA study (NCT04487080) evaluating amivantamab in combination with lazertinib versus osimertinib monotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions (ex19del) or L858R substitution mutations. The Asia cohort enrolled 501 patients who self-identified as Asian, majority of whom were based in the Asia Pacific region. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and intracranial PFS, as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) using RECIST v1.1 criteria.[9\u2020] About amivantamab Amivantamab-vmjw, a fully-human bispecific antibody targeting EGFR and MET with immune cell-directing activity, is approved in the U.S., Europe and six markets in Asia-Pacific region in combination with lazertinib for the first-line treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations. Amivantamab is approved in the U.S., Europe and thirteen markets in Asia-Pacific region in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin-pemetrexed) for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R substitution mutations, whose disease has progressed on or after treatment with an EGFR TKI. Amivantamab is approved in the U.S., Europe and thirteen markets in Asia-Pacific region in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and pemetrexed) for the first-line treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Amivantamab is approved in the U.S., Europe and twelve markets in Asia-Pacific region as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. The legal manufacturer for amivantamab is Janssen Biotech, Inc. About lazertinib In 2018, Janssen Biotech, Inc., entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Yuhan Corporation for the development of lazertinib (marketed as LECLAZA in South Korea). Lazertinib is an oral, third-generation, brain-penetrant EGFR TKI that targets both the T790M mutation and activating EGFR mutations while sparing wild-type EGFR. An analysis of the efficacy and safety of lazertinib from the Phase 3 LASER301 study was published in The Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2023.[10] The legal manufacturer for lazertinib is Janssen Biotech, Inc and Yuhan Corporation. About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Worldwide, lung cancer is one of the most common cancers, with NSCLC making up 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancer cases.[11,12] The main subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma.[13] Among the most common driver mutations in NSCLC are alterations in EGFR, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase controlling cell growth and division.[14] EGFR mutations are present in 10 to 15 percent of Western patients with NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology and occur in 40 to 50 percent of Asian patients.[11,12,15,16,17,18] EGFR ex19del or EGFR L858R mutations are the most common EGFR mutations.[19] The five-year survival rate for all people with advanced NSCLC and EGFR mutations treated with EGFR TKIs is less than 20 percent.[20,21] EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are the third most prevalent activating EGFR mutation.[22] Patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have a real-world five-year overall survival (OS) of eight percent in the frontline setting, which is worse than patients with EGFR ex19del or L858R mutations, who have a real-world five-year OS of 19 percent.[23] By comparison, other common cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer have a 5-year real world OS of 90 percent and 97 percent respectively.[24] About Johnson & Johnson At Johnson & Johnson, we believe health is everything.

Dunhuang, a pivotal hub on the ancient Silk Road, served as a crossroads where diverse civilizations converged, giving birth to the radiant splendor of the Mogao Caves. As a world-renowned treasure house of art and cultural heritage, it integrates architectural excellence, sculptural artistry, mural paintings and Buddhist culture, which embody profound historical depth, rich cultural significance, and breath-taking artistic grandeur. To showcase the contemporary brilliance of the cultural heritage, this special issue presents voices from Dunhuang's guardians, inheritors, and researchers. Through their stories, we highlight achievements in researching, excavating, interpreting, transmitting, and promoting Dunhuang's culture in the hopes of sharing the Dunhuang Model of protection and inheritance of cultural heritages with the rest of the world. \"Dun\" means grand, and \"Huang\" means prosperous. In the eyes of the ancients, Dunhuang was a magnificent and flourishing place. The Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, which date back to 366 AD, bore witness to the exchange and mutual learning of the diverse civilizations along the ancient Silk Road, making them carriers of the wisdom of the Chinese nation. In this role, they have inspired admiration and fascination in countless scholars and artists from both China and abroad. Carrying the weight of its long history, ancient Dunhuang now presents itself to the world with a renewed and graceful presence, resonating widely and profoundly in the modern era. Digital rebirth Facing the erosion of time, how can ancient grottoes retain their vitality? The Dunhuang Academy has provided an answer through its pioneering efforts. By leveraging digital and information technology, the Mogao Caves have been granted a \"digital life,\" enabling permanent preservation. After decades of exploration, the Dunhuang Academy launched the \"Digital Dunhuang\" resource library in 2016, followed by an English version in 2017. The platform provides global access to high-definition images of murals and panoramic virtual tours of 30 caves. To date, the library has recorded over 23 million visits from users across 78 countries and regions. Digitalization has not only alleviated the tension between heritage preservation and tourism, but also facilitated broader global sharing of Dunhuang's cultural and artistic resources. In the digital realm, Dunhuang is not only visible but also interactive. Launched in 2023, the \"Digital Cave of Manuscripts\" uses modern technology to replicate the physical cave and its artifacts. At the tap of a finger, users can \"travel\" across different historical periods, immersing themselves in Dunhuang's cultural experiences. The Dunhuang Academy has helped World Heritage sites around the world and in China. Its focus on the caves and related preservation, its research, education and outreach, and also very importantly, links with other nations have helped it promote cooperation, said Shahbaz Khan, director of the UNESCO Regional Office for East Asia. Interpretation of tradition Known as a nation renowned for its refined attire and ceremonial dress, China has long emphasized the beauty of clothing and ornamentation. The exquisite murals and painted sculptures of the Dunhuang Mogao Caves embody dialogues and convergences of diverse civilizations in the art of attire, offering inspiration for contemporary fashion design. \"Dunhuang serves as a bridge connecting tradition and modernity,\" said Zhang Baohua, a professor at the Academy of Art & Design, Tsinghua University, who is devoted to exploring ways to integrate traditional Chinese culture with modern art and design. While preserving the distinctive features of Dunhuang elements, he employs modern design principles to deconstruct and reassemble them, ensuring the works retain their classical essence while meeting contemporary aesthetic demands. \"We need to preserve the essence of fine traditional culture while innovating its contemporary expression,\" Zhang said. Harmony with modern civilization The Nine-Colored Deer, flying apsaras, caisson ceiling patterns... In recent years, an increasing number of Dunhuang cultural elements are integrated into daily life through illustrations, cultural and creative products, performances, and more. \"Dunhuang boasts a wealth of intellectual property (IP) resources. The key lies in how to 'discover' them,\" said Zhao Xiaoxing, a professor at the Institute of Cultural Heritage of Northwestern Polytechnical University, who once worked at the Dunhuang Academy for a decade. In her view, developing cultural and creative products first requires a deep understanding of Dunhuang culture, while second comes a creative spark that enables one to innovatively express and \"recreate\" Dunhuang elements in ways that resonate with the public. \"Dunhuang belongs to history, yet it also lives in the present,\" Zhao said. The murals of Dunhuang vividly capture diverse facets of life - from harvesting wheat and winnowing grain, to swimming and playing, traversing mountain paths, and enjoying outings in nature. As the fluttering ribbons of celestial apsaras glide across mobile screens and ancient patterns adorn living spaces, Dunhuang - this radiant jewel in the desert - continues to shine with a vitality that transcends time and space. \"In 1943, at the age of 12, I followed my father Chang Shuhong to Dunhuang. In the years that followed, I joined the adults in copying murals inside the caves.\" Chang ShanaFormer president of the Central Academy of Arts and Design \"The Dunhuang Caves are a cultural heritage of humanity. Through the study and dissemination of Dunhuang culture, we aim to promote cultural cooperation and exchange in today's world.\" Zhao ShengliangDistinguished professor at Northwest Normal University and a researcher at the Dunhuang Academy \"The Radiance of Dunhuang: Academy of Arts & Design, Tsinghua University Exhibition on Dunhuang Art and Design Achievements Special Presentation at the United Nations Headquarters will open on Monday.\" Li YingjunDeputy dean of the Academy of Arts & Design, Tsinghua University", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["tls", "art", "ite", "ent", "pub"], "creator": null, "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top"], "datatype": "news", "pubDate": "2025-12-08 00:48:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 4111305, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/en_prnasisa.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "6b93b01086928e3882793dccf068210a", "link": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/stocks-bonds-cautiously-hopeful-fed-will-deliver-5567056", "title": "Stocks, bonds cautiously hopeful Fed will deliver", "description": "SYDNEY, Dec 8 : Share and bond markets seemed guardedly optimistic on Monday that the Federal Reserve would deliver a much-needed rate cut this week, though the meeting looks set to be one of the most fractious in recent memory.Futures imply around an 86 per cent chance of a quarter-point reduction in the 3.7", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["business"], "creator": ["CNA"], "language": "english", "country": ["georgia", "yemen", "afghanistan", "cyprus", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "maldives", "japan", "united arab emirates", "malaysia", "china", "south korea", "north korea", "taiwan", "thailand", "pakistan", "mongolia", "brunei", "lebanon", "indonesia", "kyrgyzstan", "syria", "israel", "bhutan", "iran", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "kazakhstan", "iraq", "bangladesh", "laos", "vietnam", "timor-leste", "kuwait", "myanmar", "azerbaijan", "jordan", "nepal", "sri lanka", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "cambodia", "tajikistan", "oman"], "category": ["top", "business"], "datatype": "news", "pubDate": "2025-12-08 00:46:19", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--eSf3hFuR--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_468,w_830/v1/one-cms/core/2025-12-08T004619Z_1_LYNXMPELB700X_RTROPTP_3_CHINA-MARKETS.JPG?itok=0VbxbU88", "video_url": null, "source_id": "channelnewsasia", "source_name": "Channel Newsasia", "source_priority": 4763, "source_url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/channelnewsasia.jpg", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": false}], "nextPage": "1765154779929856489"}
