Featuring exceptional suction, an extendable mop for edge cleaning, and an all-in-one station for self-maintenance, the P10 Ultra ensures a thoroughly clean home with minimal manual intervention. 3i P10 Ultra, 18000Pa Deep-Cleaning Robot Vacuum with UltraReachTM Mop 3i P10 Ultra: Engineered for True Deep Cleaning The 3i P10 Ultra delivers exceptional cleaning performance with powerful suction and an innovative UltraReachTM Mop that automatically extends and retracts to clean hard-to-reach corners and along edges. Its dual spinning mops are continuously dampened, spinning at 220 RPM with downward pressure, mimicking manual mopping to remove stubborn dirt effortlessly. In addition to mopping, the P10 Ultra offers industry-leading 18,000 Pa vacuuming power, boasting over twice the suction of many competitors. It effectively picks up dust and large debris from deep within crevices and carpet fibers, making it ideal for tackling hidden dirt during spring cleaning. The anti-tangle brushes prevent hair from wrapping, while the TangleCutTM feature automatically cuts tangled hair when the robot returns to its station. For special carpet care, the P10 Ultra utilizes ultrasonic carpet detection to automatically boost suction and lift the mops 0.4 inches (10.5 mm), ensuring carpets remain dry and clean. Users can customize carpet cleaning preferences, such as prioritizing carpets, double-cleaning them, or avoiding long-pile rugs, all without manually adjusting the robot. Another key highlight is the all-in-one station for self-maintaining, which eliminates much need for manual cleaning. The station automatically washes mops with 140\u00b0F/60\u00b0C hot water and dries them with heated air, dispenses detergent and refills the robot's water tank with clean water, and collects dust and debris into a spacious bag, requiring disposal only every 70 days. Each time the robot returns to the station, it receives a complete cleaning, ready for the next use. Utilizing LiDAR, dual 3D structured light, and an AI camera, the P10 Ultra maps home layouts in 3D, detects objects even in the dark, and intelligently adapts to cleaning challenges. It recognizes over 100 types of object, avoids obstacles like slippers, cables, and socks, and adjusts its cleaning method for pet spills and liquid messes. Users can further customize their cleaning experience via the 3i App. To celebrate the 3i P10 Ultra's launch in the US, 3i is offering exclusive discounts during the spring sale (March 25\u201331): $300 off, now $799 (MSRP $1,099). The P10 Ultra will also be released on Amazon DE/FR/IT/ES from April 1st, for a special launch price of 799 \u20ac (MSRP 999 \u20ac). Spring Into a Cleaner Home 3i is also offering major discounts on its flagship, the S10 Ultra, the world's first WaterRecycleTM Floor Washing Robot Vacuum. This model delivers a more effortless hands-free cleaning experience, as its WaterRecycleTM station distills wastewater for reuse and can even extract fresh water from the air. This totally eliminates the need to manually dump dirty water or frequently refill the clean water tank. Unlike traditional setups, there's no need for plumbing, either, allowing users to place and move the station freely. The S10 also features an extendable roller mop that can self-clean while mopping, making it especially effective at handling tough wet messes like ketchup on hardwood floors. During the spring sale (March 25\u201331), the 3i S10 Ultra is available for $1,299/1,299 \u20ac after a $600/400 \u20ac discount on Amazon US and EU(DE/FR/IT/ES).

Fab Equipment Spending Fab equipment spending is projected to rise by 18% in the following year, reaching $130 billion. This growth in investment is driven not only by demand in the high-performance computing (HPC) and memory sectors to support data center expansions, but also by the increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI), which is driving up the silicon content required for edge devices. \"The global semiconductor industry's investments in fab equipment have been edging up for six straight years, and spending is poised to see a strong 18% increase in 2026 as production ramps to meet booming AI-related chip demand,\" said Ajit Manocha, SEMI President and CEO. \"This forecasted capex growth signals an urgent need for intensified workforce development initiatives throughout 2025 and 2026 to deliver skilled workers necessary for the approximately 50 new fabs expected to come online during these two years.\" Logic & Micro Segment Lead Semiconductor Industry Expansion The Logic & Micro segment is anticipated to be a key driver of growth in fab investments. This growth is primarily fueled by investments in cutting-edge technologies, such as 2-nanometer process and backside power delivery technology, which are expected to enter production by 2026. The Logic & Micro segment is projected to see an 11% increase in investments, reaching $52 billion in 2025, followed by a 14% increase to $59 billion in 2026. Overall Memory segment spending is expected to grow steadily the next two years, increasing by 2% to reach $32 billion by 2025, with an even stronger growth forecast of 27% in 2026. Investments in the DRAM segment are projected to decline by 6% year-over-year, totaling $21 billion in 2025, but are anticipated to rebound with a 19% increase to $25 billion in 2026. Conversely, NAND segment spending is expected to recover significantly, rising by 54% year-over-year to $10 billion in 2025, and further increasing by 47% to $15 billion in 2026. Mainland China Continues to Lead in Regional Fab Equipment Spending Despite a decline from a peak of $50 billion in 2024, Mainland China is expected to maintain its position as the leader in global semiconductor equipment spending, with projections of $38 billion in 2025 representing a 24% year-over-year decrease. By 2026, spending is forecast to decline further 5% year-over-year to $36 billion. With the growing penetration of AI technology driving higher memory adoption, Korean chipmakers are planning to invest more in equipment for capacity expansion and technology upgrades, which is expected to position the region as the second highest spending through 2026. Korean investment is forecasted to grow by 29% to $21.5 billion in 2025 and by 26% to $27 billion in 2026. Taiwan is set to secure third place in spending as its chipmakers aim to enhance their leadership in advanced technology and production capabilities. Taiwan is projected to spend $21 billion in 2025 and $24.5 billion in 2026 to meet the growing demand for AI applications across cloud services and edge devices. The Americas region ranks fourth, with expected spending of $14 billion in 2025 and $20 billion in 2026. Japan, Europe and the Middle East, and Southeast Asia follow in investments, projected to spend $14 billion, $9 billion, and $4 billion in 2025, and $11 billion, $7 billion, and $4 billion in 2026, respectively. The latest update of the SEMI World Fab Forecast report, published in March, lists more than 1,500 facilities and lines globally, including 156 facilities and lines with various probabilities expected to start operation in 2025 or later.
