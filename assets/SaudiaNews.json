The successful debut in 2023 has confirmed Singapore as the gateway to the Asia-Pacific market and Vinexpo Asia 2025 will return to Singapore with an in-depth program designed to meet the challenges facing the industry today. SINGAPORE, THE HUB OF SOUTHEAST ASIA'S GROWTH Vinexpo Asia 2025 will take place from 27 \u2013 29 May, set at the iconic Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. This edition will bring together 1,100 exhibitors from over 20 countries and welcome 11,000 professional visitors from 70 countries, offering three days of unmatched business opportunities. Rodolphe Lameyse, CEO of the Vinexposium group, shares, \"The global wine and spirits industry faces a pivotal geo-economic challenge with declining consumption worldwide. In this context, seizing commercial opportunities is imperative. Southeast Asia, with Singapore as its key business hub, is where growth happens. Vinexpo Asia in May will be the prime event for industry leaders to connect and thrive in this dynamic region\" This year's Vinexpo Asia in Singapore will attract stakeholders from diverse markets in Asia Pacific, including mature wine markets like Japan, South Korea and China. The event is also well-positioned to open opportunities to emerging markets that promise great growth, such as Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. According to the IWSR, Asia Pacific accounts for 10% of global wine imports, with beverage alcohol consumption forecast to grow in 2025 by 1.5%, rising to 5.9% for the ready-to-drink segment. Singapore alone represents a mature yet dynamic market, with 3% growth in the wine sector projected by 2025. The city of Singapore alone represents an increasingly attractive market with a respective 2.18% CAGR in volume through 2028 for Wine and 3% for spirits. Gastronomy and wine are particularly dynamic, with 54 restaurants awarded Michelin stars in 2024 alone. Singapore is also Asia's most favorable region for the premium and above category with a market share of 60% in volume. Whilst highly competitive, the Singapore wine and spirits market gains ground year-on-year and constantly welcomes new products, provided their marketing strategy caters to its specific needs. AN IN-DEPTH, DYNAMIC PROGRAMME Vinexpo Asia 2025 will return to Singapore as an even more dynamic and robust trade show. The exhibition will welcome exhibitors from such diverse producing regions as France, Italy and Australia (top 3 countries), along with Spain, New Zealand, South Africa, Mexico, United Kingdom, to name a few. Asian producers from China and Japan are also set to make an impactful showing, while South American representation from Argentina and Chile will also be spotlighted. Introduced in Singapore for the first time, the Welcome to the Organic World (WOW!) section will also offer visitors an opportunity to explore the diverse range of organic and biodynamic wines produced globally. For the first time, the award-winning collective Wines Unearthed will make a debut at Vinexpo Asia, offering a unique one-stop showcase of boutique producers who are looking for distributors in the region. At Vinexpo Asia 2025, spirits will also make a strong showing, with representation from Japan, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, France, and China, highlighting the current trends. The highly anticipated Vinexpo Academy programme will once again offer visitors an opportunity to experience insightful high-level masterclasses, conferences, and discovery tastings. The line-up includes top sommeliers from around the globe, discussions on current-day issues in wine and spirits markets and rare opportunities to taste specialty wine vintages.
