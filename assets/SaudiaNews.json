"description": "Collaboration aims to revolutionize video production of advertisements in Japan TOKYO, May 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Tencent Cloud, the cloud business of global technology company Tencent, and Offshore Company, a subsidiary of PR firm Vector Group, which ranks sixth globally and first in Asia[1], today proudly announced the launch of \"AvaMo,\" Japan's first AI-powered avatar video generation service specifically designed for the Japanese market[2]. Powered by Tencent Cloud's advanced digital human creation technology, AvaMo enables the quick creation of professional-quality videos, dramatically reducing both production time and costs by up to 98%[3]\u2014a true game changer for producing video advertisements. Tencent Cloud and Vector Group\u2019s Offshore Company Launch Japan\u2019s First AI Avatar Video Generation Service \u201cAvaMo\u201d \"AvaMo\" is an AI video generation service developed by Offshore Company with technology provided by Tencent Cloud. The name \"AvaMo\" combines the words \"Avatar\" and \"Motion/Movie,\" representing its ability to create high-quality videos featuring AI avatars with natural movements. The service is versatile, catering to a wide range of use cases, including advertising, customer support, and educational content. Addressing the Needs of a Rapidly Growing Market The global AI video generation market has been rapidly expanding, with projections estimating its value at $4.1 billion (approx. \u00a5582.2 billion) in 2024 and $62.8 billion (approx. \u00a58.93 trillion) by 2034, growing at a compound annual rate of 31.38%[4]. However, in Japan, AI-generated video and voice technologies are still in their infancy, with most applications focused on text and image generation. Comprehensive commercial use of AI in video production remains limited. While global services like \"Synthesia\" and \"HeyGen\" have gained traction, Japan lacks services optimized for the domestic market, particularly in terms of Japanese-language support, avatar designs tailored for Japanese audiences, and user-friendly interfaces. AvaMo fills this gap, offering a solution tailored for Japanese users\u2014with Japanese avatars, voiceovers, and an intuitive UI\u2014while also supporting multilingual and global business needs. Revolutionizing Video Production with AvaMo Conventional video production involves multiple steps: planning, scripting, storyboarding, filming, and editing\u2014often taking weeks to months and incurring significant costs. AvaMo simplifies this process by integrating templates, AI avatars, and natural text-to-speech (TTS) technology, allowing users to create professional-quality videos with just a few clicks. Powered by Tencent Cloud's AI-driven digital human creation technology and Offshore Company's intuitive interface, AvaMo makes video production more accessible to enterprises in Japan. Key Features of AvaMo: UI/UX Design Optimized for Japanese Market Templates, audio, and avatar expressions are fine-tuned for Japanese users. AI voice technology reproduces authentic Japanese intonation. Avatar models reflect Japanese corporate culture and lifestyle nuances. Beginner-Friendly, Automated Workflow AI handles scenario creation, casting, filming support, and audio recording. Simple, click-based interface allows users with no prior experience to create compelling videos. Realistic Digital Human (Avatar) Generation Advanced AI generates lifelike avatars with nuanced facial expressions, lip-sync, and gestures. Avatars are created from short video samples (1\u20133 minutes), ensuring high-fidelity and real-time responsiveness. Versatile Templates and Custom Avatars Wide range of templates for advertising, branding, product demos, manuals, and more. Supports vertical video formats for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. Over 120 avatar types available, with options for custom avatars[5] using personal face and voice data. Multilingual Support TTS supports English, Chinese, Korean, and more than ten other languages, facilitating cross-border campaigns. Prevention of AI misuse and Privacy Protection Strict adherence to ethical and legal standards, including user consent and dual-layer content moderation (AI + human review). Proactive measures against misuse, including account suspension and reporting to authorities for serious violations.
