This challenge, hosted by Meta, Google, Samsung, Naver, China Mobile, Northwestern Polytechnical University and Nexdata, aims to advance multilingual conversational speech AI by providing a real-world dataset and encouraging innovation in speech language models. The challenge consists of two tasks, both of which require participants to explore the development of speech language models (SLMs): Task I: Multilingual Conversational Speech Recognition Objective: Develop a multilingual LLM-based ASR model. Participants will be provided with oracle segmentation and speaker labels for each conversation. Task II: Multilingual Conversational Speech Diarization and Recognition Objective: Develop a system for both speaker diarization (identifying who is speaking when), and recognition (transcribing speech to text). No prior or oracle information will be provided during evaluation (e.g., no pre-segmented utterances or speaker labels). Both pipeline-based and end-to-end systems are encouraged, providing flexibility in system design and implementation. The training set (Train) comprises approximately 11 languages: English (en), French (fr), German (de), Italian (it), Portuguese (pt), Spanish (es), Japanese (jp), Korean (ko), Russian (ru), Thai (th), Vietnamese (vi). It's designed to provide a rich resource for training and evaluating multilingual conversational speech language models (MLC-SLM), addressing the challenges of linguistic diversity, speaker variability, and contextual understanding.

SEOUL, South Korea, March 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- NAVER D2SF has made a new investment in \"Anchor Node\" (CEO Won Jae-ho), a startup developing game production solutions powered by generative AI. Anchor Node's team consists of industry veterans with over 20 years of experience in the gaming industry, possessing extensive expertise and knowledge across all aspects of game production, including producing, development, and artwork. Anchor Node's game production AI solution, \"GameAIfy,\" streamlines the game development process by using AI to automatically generate artwork\u2014such as images, motion, and backgrounds\u2014from just character concepts. Built on AI models specialized in creating game artwork, it offers style-consistent outputs tailored to specific game elements and design concepts. It also includes advanced features to enhance workflow efficiency in game art creation, such as artwork editing, sharing, history management, with tools like Remix, ControlNet, and character customization, making it easy to modify artwork. Anchor Node has already validated its product value and competitiveness by developing and releasing four games in collaboration with intellectual property (IP) holders, achieving 1.25 million downloads.
