HONG KONG, Dec. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Rosewood Hotel Group (\"the Group\") today announces continued expansion of its global development pipeline with the on-schedule opening of Rosewood Courchevel Le Jardin Alpin, the Group's first ski resort. A landmark debut for the brand, the new alpine retreat marks Rosewood's entry into a new sector and reinforces the Group's presence across some of the world's most sought after destinations and high-growth markets. Rosewood Courchevel Le Jardin Alpin This debut follows seven on-track openings in 2025, including the milestone launch of Rosewood's first standalone residential property available for exclusive sale, Rosewood Residences Beverly Hills in the United States, reaffirming the Group's expansion into the luxury residential category and its strategic focus to redefine private branded residences by creating neighborhood landmarks that appreciate in both emotional and financial value. Together with the forthcoming launch of Rosewood AMAALA in Saudi Arabia, set to bring an ultra-luxury regenerative escape to the Red Sea region. These additions underscore the Group's commitment to quality\u2010driven expansion and elevating operational excellence across its global portfolio. Sonia Cheng, Chief Executive Officer of Rosewood Hotel Group, said: \"Rosewood Courchevel Le Jardin Alpin, our first ski resort, is a milestone that reflects our long\u2010term commitment to thoughtfully expanding our global portfolio and our ability to enter new, experience-driven sectors.\" \"We are guided by a clear ambition: to grow with purpose, to create enduring value, and to deliver transformative experiences that resonate with our communities. As we bring our brands to the world's most extraordinary destinations, our vision and commitment remain focused on quality, innovation, and the sustainable success of our global business.

The resort also offers luxury accommodations, elevated dining concepts, curated wellness experiences, and direct ski\u2010in/ski\u2010out access, providing guests with an intimate retreat that celebrates the distinct character and natural beauty of the French Alps.
