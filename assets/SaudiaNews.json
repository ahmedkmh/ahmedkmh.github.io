(TPEx: 7827), a global clinical-stage biotechnology company advancing next-generation immunotherapies for oncology and autoimmune diseases, today announced the presentation of two late-breaking abstracts on its lead asset, HCB101, at the 40th Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC), held November 5-9, 2025, in National Harbor, Maryland. Both datasets were accepted for late-breaking poster presentations, highlighting the program's potential impact on innate immune checkpoint blockade. HCB101, a Next-Generation Fc-Engineered SIRP\u03b1-CD47 Fusion Protein, Demonstrates Favorable Safety and Early Antitumor Activity in Advanced Cancers HCB101's progress reflects its distinct engineering compared to earlier CD47-targeting approaches. First-generation CD47 antibodies, such as magrolimab and lemzoparlimab, demonstrated clinical activity but faced significant safety or efficacy challenges, leading to discontinuations or halted collaborations. Second-generation wild-type SIRP\u03b1 fusions, such as maplirpacept (TTI-622), improved safety but did not deliver sufficient efficacy in solid tumors, limiting their adoption. IgG1-based fusions attempted to boost immune activation but triggered excessive Fc\u03b3-mediated toxicity and poor tolerability, restricting their use mainly to hematologic malignancies. Third-generation engineered SIRP\u03b1 fusions with inactivated IgG1 Fc improved safety in combinations but showed limited standalone efficacy. \"The acceptance of two late-breaking abstracts at SITC for HCB101 monotherapy and combination therapy, along with our earlier preclinical abstract for HCB301, a tri-specific fusion targeting SIRP\u03b1/CD47, PD-1/PD-L1, and TGF\u03b2, reinforces the scientific breadth of our platform across innate and adaptive immunity,\" said Scott Liu, Ph.D., Founder, Chairman, and CEO of HanchorBio. \"HCB101 was purposely engineered to overcome the cytopenias seen with first-generation anti-CD47 antibodies while maintaining potent immune activation. In second-line gastric cancer, the combination of HCB101 with standard-of-care therapy achieved a 100% confirmed response rate in the active-dose cohort, far exceeding the 28% ORR benchmark from the RAINBOW trial. These results position HCB101 not just as a safer SIRP\u03b1-CD47 backbone, but as a next-generation macrophage checkpoint immunotherapy with best-in-class potential.\" Late-Breaking Abstract Highlights (Data as of August 2025) 1. HCB101-101 Monotherapy Study (NCT05892718) Title: HCB101, a Next-Generation Fc-Engineered SIRP\u03b1-CD47 Fusion Protein, Demonstrates Favorable Safety and Early Antitumor Activity in Advanced Cancers In the ongoing Phase 1a dose-escalation, no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) have been observed at doses up to 24 mg/kg. CD47 receptor occupancy \u226599% achieved at doses \u22655 mg/kg, with dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. Confirmed partial responses seen in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). Several patients achieved stable disease, with progression-free survival up to 32 weeks. 2. HCB101-201 Combination Therapy Study (NCT06771622) Title: Phase 1b/2a Study of HCB101 Combined with Standard Therapies Demonstrates Manageable Safety and Dose-Dependent Antitumor Activity in Immunologically Cold Advanced Solid Tumors In second-line gastric cancer (GC): 100% confirmed partial response rate (6/6 evaluable patients) at active doses when combined with ramucirumab and paclitaxel. Tumor shrinkage up to 78%, surpassing the ~26.5% ORR benchmark from RAINBOW. In first-line triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC): Confirmed partial response with 73% tumor reduction at the effective dose. Safety was manageable and consistent with the cytopenia-sparing design, with only minimal hematologic effects observed. Dr. Fangling Ning, Investigator from the Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical University, commented, \"What's unique about HCB101 is that it avoids the cytopenias that plagued anti-CD47 antibodies by minimizing red blood cell binding, while still engaging CD47 strongly on tumor cells. In our gastric cancer cohort, the responses at active doses are encouraging in a patient population that historically has had limited options. These findings validate HCB101's unique design and suggest meaningful potential in immunologically cold tumors.\" About HCB101: A Differentiated CD47-SIRP\u03b1 Blockade HCB101 is a 3.5th-generation, affinity-optimized SIRP\u03b1-Fc fusion protein with an intact IgG4 Fc backbone, developed using HanchorBio's proprietary FBDBTM platform. It is engineered for selective CD47 targeting with low red blood cell (RBC) binding, thereby avoiding the anemia and thrombocytopenia commonly associated with earlier anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies, while preserving strong antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and innate-to-adaptive immune bridging. Key differentiators of HCB101: Enhanced safety: Cytopenia-sparing profile, with no DLTs observed up to 30 mg/kg and receptor occupancy >90% at \u22651.28 mg/kg, supporting a broad therapeutic window. Robust immune activation: Engineered to enhance ADCP and bridge innate-to-adaptive immunity, with evidence of durable immune-mediated tumor control in monotherapy. Broad tumor applicability: Demonstrated activity across >80 PDX and CDX preclinical models, with early clinical signals in gastric cancer, TNBC, HNSCC, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and ovarian cancer. Clinical translation: Shows durable disease control as monotherapy and a 100% confirmed partial response rate (6/6) in 2L gastric cancer when combined with ramucirumab and paclitaxel, with additional confirmed responses in 1L TNBC and 2L HNSCC, substantially exceeding historical benchmarks.

The China International Import Expo offers an important window into how these objectives are being put into practice. This year's CIIE has attracted 4,108 international companies, a record high. Among them, many have been loyal participants for eight consecutive years, including Theland, a New Zealand-based dairy brand. When this company first entered the Chinese market, it was frustrated that fresh dairy products struggled with a short shelf life, as fresh milk often reached Chinese retailers already close to expiry. Thanks to facilitative policies introduced via the CIIE, these products enjoyed a \"ranch-to-table in 72 hours\" supply chain, solving the dilemma once and for all. Via the CIIE, Theland's sales in China have spiked, and new products debuted at the CIIE quickly reached consumers across cities and towns of all tiers nationwide. Today, these dairy products from the southern hemisphere have become a familiar sight in the fridges of Chinese households. The growth trajectory of foreign-funded companies represented by Theland epitomizes the powerful adaptability of the Chinese market. It also serves as a looking glass through which to envision China's future development and opening-up. There are multiple pillars that will consolidate the foundation for China's high-quality development in the next five years, while providing steady momentum for international companies' growth in China. The first pillar lies in the effective support of sound policies and institutional frameworks. From trade facilitation measures such as the single-window system for international trade, to efforts under various frameworks to align domestic market rules with international standards, opening-up at the institutional level has enabled China to dismantle barriers to development. Meanwhile, reforms to streamline administration and delegate power, improve regulation and optimize services, as well as policies promoting fair competition have steadily cut down institutional transaction costs of foreign-invested companies, making their expected returns more stable. The recommendations for the 15th Five-Year Plan identify high-quality development as the primary objective for the period, and provide clear guidance on high-standard opening-up. These will no doubt set up a stable and forward-looking framework for the next stage of development and international collaboration. The second pillar lies in the twin engines of market and industry. China boasts a population of over 1.4 billion and a middle-income group of 400 million people-a market of such unparalleled scale can fuel consumption upgrading and catalyze the emergence of new business forms, attracting foreign-invested enterprises in terms of current purchasing power and long-term potential. On the other hand, such a giant market serves as a testing ground for the iteration of various industries. The Recommendations for the 15th Five-Year Plan have proposed to accelerate the development of industrial clusters in strategic emerging sectors, which are expected to generate markets worth trillions of yuan or beyond. This also means brand-new cooperation space for foreign investment. The third pillar is the new vitality unleashed by innovation and coordination. China continues to expand investment in research and development, improving its fundamental R&D capacity, leveraging innovation to open new frontiers for growth. Meanwhile, China's coordinated regional development strategy will unlock the potential of Central and Western China and that of lower-tier markets, further broadening the reach of high-quality development. Backed by the high-quality performance of the Chinese economy, foreign-invested companies will also enjoy the bonus of both market opportunities and new growth tracks. With these pillars and driving forces in place, China has continued to deliver impressive results in high-quality development, while its opening-up initiatives, exemplified by the CIIE, have borne fruitful results in international cooperation. The world has every reason to believe that guided by the objectives of the 15th Five-Year Plan, China will further lead the trend in high-quality development, while cultivating a fertile ground for foreign-invested companies in China, so that a prosperous future can be shared by all.
