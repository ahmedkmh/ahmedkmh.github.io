The opening of this new lounge marks the first milestone following a strategic investment in Blue Sky Group's subsidiary PT Bumi Liputan Angkasa, announced in March. This expansion into Indonesia sees Airport Dimensions bringing its world-class expertise and market-leading capabilities to a new region. It joins a network of over 80 airport lounges and experiences, further enhancing airport hospitality offerings and elevating the overall passenger experience worldwide. As the 17th lounge in its growing Asia-Pacific network, this opening reflects the accelerating demand for premium airport services in high-growth markets and the company's ongoing strategic expansion across the region. Blue Sky Premier Lounge Makassar responds to the rise in passenger traffic at Makassar Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, now exceeding one million travellers per month, and the city's rapid emergence as a dynamic metropolitan hub in Eastern Indonesia. Designed with both comfort and sophistication in mind, the space reflects Makassar's growing status as a centre of air travel, business, and tourism. Located within the domestic terminal of Makassar Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport and with a prime position next to security and only minutes from the gate, the lounge offers comfort and convenience at the heart of the terminal. With 500 square meters of space and seating for up to 137 guests, passengers can relax in a thoughtfully designed space that combines sleek modern style with authentic regional character. Blue Sky Premier Lounge Makassar is purposefully designed to showcase the essence of local culture and identity. Rooted in Indonesia's rich heritage, the lounge features locally crafted Batik motifs, design elements that echo Makassar's history as a coastal port city and was brought to life in close collaboration with local suppliers from concept to construction. The menu, crafted with extensive market knowledge, features locally inspired dishes made from locally sourced ingredients. Food-loving travellers can look forward to all-you-can-eat buffet-style dining, featuring Blue Sky's much-loved signature Mantau recipe. Each day, a rotating selection of regional favourites will be on offer, including Coto Makassar, Pisang Ijo, I-ta Suki's steamboat specialty noodles and other local delicacies. A variety of live-cooked dishes that bring culinary experience to life are also available throughout the day. A dedicated coffee corner invites coffee enthusiasts to enjoy Ippolito, Blue Sky's signature in-house coffee brand, locally roasted and widely celebrated for its rich flavour. Guests can also enjoy a selection of cold-pressed juices from the Healthy Corner, unlimited Le Minerale premium water and soft drinks. With a thoughtfully designed end-to-end service, the lounge redefines the traditional airport experience, offering comfort and care that begins well before guests step inside the lounge. From dedicated ambassadors positioned throughout the terminal to assist with check-in to a seamless buggy service transporting guests from lounge to gate at the Drop Zone, every element of the lounge has been curated to elevate convenience and deliver an integrated travel experience that feels both effortless and exceptional. For guests needing to catch up on work before their flight, the lounge offers two dedicated productivity zones equipped with high-speed WiFi to keep travellers connected. Those looking to freshen up can take advantage of well-appointed showers and restrooms. A key highlight is the VIP private rooms, which provide an elevated level of privacy and comfort, complete with plush seating and refreshments for an additional fee. To accommodate the diverse needs of travellers, the lounge also features separate prayer rooms for men and women, offering a quiet space for reflection and worship. For families traveling with young children, a nursery room is also available, offering a comfortable and private space for families. The lounge also includes a spacious dedicated smoking wing with Honeywell air purification systems ensuring air quality remains uncompromised throughout the lounge.

The awards reflect the company's growing influence as a purpose-driven pharmaceutical firm that integrates sustainability and human well-being into its corporate DNA. TSH Biopharm's Green Leadership accolade celebrates its signature initiative, \"Sowing with Heart,\" which redefines the connection between health and the environment. In a pioneering effort, the company partnered with organic farmers in Miaoli's Formosan leopard cat conservation area, supporting pesticide-free rice cultivation. The harvested rice is transformed into thoughtfully crafted gift sets\u2014ranging from fermented rice beverages to eco-friendly soap products\u2014whose proceeds are donated in full to elder care organizations. By uniting biodiversity protection, local farming, and public health, TSH Biopharm demonstrates that environmental stewardship can be deeply human at its core. Equally impactful is the company's award-winning \"Empowered Journeys\" initiative, which earned it recognition for Social Empowerment. Launched in collaboration with the Old Five Old Foundation, the program operates mobile grocery trucks that serve isolated seniors in Taiwan's rural regions. Unlike traditional charity models, this service restores autonomy by allowing elders to choose their own supplies. With TSH Biopharm employees volunteering as delivery companions, the initiative extends beyond material support, offering emotional connection and dignity to the elderly\u2014an approach that reshapes how businesses engage with aging populations. The success of both programs highlights TSH Biopharm's long-standing commitment to values-driven leadership. Its environmental project rejuvenates fallow land and raises public awareness about endangered species, while its social initiative brings healthcare philosophy into daily life, affirming that true wellness can flourish with community support. As TSH Biopharm continues to evolve, it remains steadfast in its mission: to build a future where healthcare is not only about treatment, but also about creating harmony between people and the planet.
