Their influence increasingly transcends wealth and innovation, extending into governance, standard-setting, and cultural interpretation. Dr. Joe (Yizhou) He and the Architecture of Global Capital\u2019s Next Chapter Standing at the intersection of these rising tides is Dr. Joe (Yizhou) He, Managing Director and CEO China of Australian Capital Equity, who has emerged as a distinctive bridge between global investors and the world's most complex, dynamic emerging markets. From institutional allocators to family offices to corporate leaders, Dr. He occupies an unusual and valuable position: someone fluent in the operating logic of China, the expectations of Western capital, and the practical pathways that connect the two. \"International capital doesn't just need access \u2014 it needs structure, clarity, and someone who can translate complexity into opportunity.\" The Architecture of Understanding: A Career Forged Across Systems Dr. He's global perspective runs deeper than resume lines. After completing his master's degree at the University of Cambridge, he began his career in a global investment bank, drawn less to titles than to complexity. \"Global markets reward those who understand the logic behind the logic.\" he recalls. His early years at Fosun Group put him on the front lines of cross-border investment. In his twenties, he took part in the acquisition in the Middle East \u2014 working in 50-degree heat, navigating cultural barriers, and managing geopolitical uncertainty. It was a formative experience. \"A deal doesn't succeed because numbers align\u2014it succeeds because interests align.\" It taught him that global investment is not merely financial\u2014it is anthropological, psychological, and deeply structural. Investment Philosophy and Global Trends: Reading the World Through Structure Dr. He's investment worldview \u2014 shaped by experience across Asia, the U.S., the Middle East, Europe, and Australia \u2014 is grounded in a single conviction: long-term value emerges from structure, not sentiment. His approach seamlessly connects investment principles with a clear-eyed reading of global shifts. He focuses on three enduring foundations that guide how he interprets both companies and entire economies: 1. Productivity as the North Star Whether AI, blockchain, or digital infrastructure, he looks for technologies that permanently raise human productivity. \"Productivity is the only compounding force that never reverses.\" 2. Structure Over Sentiment He cautions global investors against the emotional narratives that drive short-term market cycles. \"Sentiment follows structure. If you understand regulation, industry formation, and cost curves, you will outperform narratives.\" 3. Value Creation Before Capital Extraction Across emerging markets, he believes global capital performs best when it creates durable industrial value rather than pursuing quick arbitrage. \"International investors who create real industrial value always outperform those looking for arbitrage.\" Building on these principles, Dr. He applies a framework for interpreting global trends that avoids ideological lenses and focuses instead on structural inevitabilities: AI and Blockchain as Twin Transformations AI as the next engine of enterprise productivity; blockchain as the architecture for future trust and cross-border transaction systems. Parallel Innovation Systems He sees not a world converging toward one technological model, but multiple innovation systems \u2014 Silicon Valley, East Asia, the Middle East \u2014 evolving in parallel, sometimes competitive, often complementary. \"The next decade will not be defined by convergence, but by coexistence.\" Capital Corridors Across Regions With experience spanning Australia, China, the Middle East, and the U.S., he has witnessed new financial corridors forming \u2014 especially around supply-chain security, energy transition, and sovereign investment. Asia-Pacific as the Next Structural Center of Gravity He believes APAC will become the world's most dynamic region for cross-border capital, not because of short-term cycles but due to demographic scale, technology supply chains, and structural demand. The Quiet Power of Curiosity: Stories Behind the Strategy What distinguishes Dr. He in the global investment community is not only his technical clarity but also the way he approaches people and organizations. Middle Eastern Heat, A Young Negotiator, and a Lesson in Humility During the acquisition in the Middle East, local partners were initially skeptical of the young negotiator across the table. Instead of confronting doubt, Dr. He relied on preparation, cultural sensitivity, and quiet confidence. Trust was built not by force, but by clarity. Many years later, he still recalls the smell of the desert air at night, the silence of the foreign office buildings, and the moment he realized he was becoming \"a global operator, not just a deal-maker.\" A Question That Reveals Culture In his early days at Australian Capital Equity, he asked a group of senior executives: \"What made you stay here for 20 or 30 years?\" The answers \u2014 consistency, integrity, purpose \u2014 convinced him that longevity in business is not luck but culture. \"That question told me more about the company than any financial statement.\" he says. Building Pathways, Not Just Portfolios At Australian Capital Equity, Dr. He now focuses on helping global capital deploy into China and Asia in ways that are deliberate, structured, and aligned with long-term opportunity. He rejects binary thinking and instead emphasizes clarity, risk design, and sustainable value creation. \"Capital moves where there is trust. Trust grows where there is understanding.\" His work centers on building that understanding \u2014 between China and multinational headquarters, between emerging technologies and global investors, and between regions whose futures are becoming increasingly interdependent. A Leader for the Next Investment Epoch In a world defined by uncertainty, Dr. Joe (Yizhou) He offers something rare: a viewpoint that is both analytical and human, ambitious yet grounded, young yet mature. For global investors seeking to interpret Asia's next cycle \u2014 and to participate in it with confidence \u2014 he stands as one of the most compelling voices of his generation. \"The future belongs to those who can translate complexity into clarity \u2014 and clarity into action.\"", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["pub", "avo", "fin", "cpr"], "creator": null, "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top"], "datatype": "news", "pubDate": "2025-11-26 01:01:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://mma.prnasia.com/media2/2830645/Dr__Joe__Yizhou__He_and_the_Architecture_of_Global_Capital_s_Next_Chapter.jpg?p=medium600", "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 4111305, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/en_prnasisa.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": true}, {"article_id": "5a3f4e5d1dcfc1d09f6e4b7fa1949919", "link": "https://menafn.com/1110398583/India-Well-Positioned-To-Become-Innovation-Led-Pharma-Giant-In-Next-5-Years-CDSCO", "title": "India Well-Positioned To Become Innovation-Led Pharma Giant In Next 5 Years: CDSCO", "description": "(MENAFN -

BANDUNG, Indonesia, Nov. 26, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Lincah, one of Indonesia's fastest-growing commerce infrastructure platforms, today announced the acquisition of Orderfaz, absorbing its platform, technology, and customer base as part of Lincah's strategy to strengthen the region's unified social and creator-commerce ecosystem. The move positions Lincah as a leading player in a sector projected to exceed $100 billion in Southeast Asia by 2028, driven by the rapid rise of creator-led commerce and the increasing reliance of MSMEs on social channels. Lincah Acquires Orderfaz to Strengthen Southeast Asia\u2019s Social Commerce Infrastructure Lincah currently supports more than 23,000 merchants and 8.3 million buyers, processing over 500,000 transactions per month across major social and marketing platforms including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube and Google Ads. With Orderfaz now integrated, Lincah gains expanded capabilities that allow for greater platform reliability, stronger operational alignment and a more seamless seller experience across markets. \"Indonesia is emerging as the anchor market for social commerce in Southeast Asia,\" said Juan Lesmana, president of the group at Lincah. \"By bringing Orderfaz's technology and seller ecosystem under Lincah, we are building a more streamlined, stable and scalable infrastructure that reduces complexity for sellers and enables them to grow across markets more efficiently.\" Indonesia leads Southeast Asia in social commerce adoption, accounting for more than 52 percent of the region's GMV, with over 70 percent of local MSMEs relying on social platforms as their primary sales channel. This expanding market combined with a 17 to 25 percent annual growth rate creates strong momentum for infrastructure players like Lincah. Lincah's ecosystem is further strengthened by Yudha Trisna and Muhamad Azis Rifai, respected community leaders who bring extensive experience in market behavior, seller communities and ecosystem development. Their involvement helps ensure that Lincah's product and strategy remain closely aligned with the evolving needs of Indonesian and Southeast Asian sellers. The group's strategic direction is led by Juan Lesmana, who brings more than 10 years of experience in global e-commerce, technology and management consulting, including previous roles at TikTok (Bytedance) and Tokopedia. Juan joined Lincah in early 2025 as an angel investor and senior advisor, working closely with the leadership team before stepping into a broader executive role focused on strategic alignment, organizational expansion and the development of a unified, multi-market commerce infrastructure. Mohamad Iqbal has been appointed group CEO, responsible for leading platform integration, strengthening operational cohesion and driving Lincah's expansion into new Southeast Asian markets. As Lincah solidifies its foundation in Indonesia and prepares strategic entry into Malaysia, the company is increasing investment in platform capabilities, infrastructure resilience and long-term scalability. With Orderfaz now fully absorbed, Lincah is positioned to deliver greater value, broader regional reach and next-generation infrastructure for sellers, partners and investors across Southeast Asia. Lincah is entering a new phase of regional growth, one that requires strategic investment and long-term capital alignment to support its multi-country roadmap and the rapidly rising demand for unified social commerce infrastructure across Southeast Asia. About Lincah Lincah is a Southeast Asia\u2013focused commerce infrastructure platform providing integrated solutions across order management, customer engagement, payments and logistics. With an expanding regional presence and a strong operator-led leadership team, Lincah empowers sellers and creators to scale efficiently across multiple platforms and markets.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["stw", "cxp", "ecm", "cpr", "tnm", "per"], "creator": null, "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["business", "top"], "datatype": "news", "pubDate": "2025-11-26 01:00:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://mma.prnasia.com/media2/2829609/Lincah_Acquires_Orderfaz_to_Strengthen_Southeast_Asia_s_Social_Commerce_Infrastructure.jpg?p=medium600", "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 4111305, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/en_prnasisa.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "6c708eded519029dae3ecd8a03f7fdff", "link": "https://en.prnasia.com/story/513566-0.shtml", "title": "Kontron Launches New Industrial Computer KBox E-430-RPL/RPH", "description": "To Help Integrators & Developers Bring Intelligence to Their Applications TAIPEI, Nov. 26, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Kontron, a leading global provider of IoT / Embedded Computing Technology, launches a new industrial computer, named KBox E-430-RPL/RPH, providing integrators and developers with a robust compact computing platform to develop diverse smart applications, such as smart manufacturing, smart healthcare, smart retail and smart city.
