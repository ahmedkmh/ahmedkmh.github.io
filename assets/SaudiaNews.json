Thailand, Feb. 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Thailand's hospitality industry has reached a new milestone with Furama Hotel Chiang Mai, the first hotel in the country to deeply integrate smart technology into its operations. Powered by KEENON Robotics' advanced service robots, this transformation marks a significant leap in enhancing guest experiences and operational efficiency in the hotel sector. The official launch ceremony on 20 February 2025, brought together industry leaders, government officials, including Former MP Suraphol Kietchaiyakorn, Advisor to the Minister of Tourism and Sports, and Mr. Wiraphong Ritrod, Deputy Governor of Chiang Mai Province. The event highlighted the role of KEENON's robotic solutions in streamlining hotel services, from autonomous delivery to smart cleaning. Smart Technology Elevating Hospitality Located in the heart of Chiang Mai, Furama Hotel Chiang Mai is the first in Thailand to integrate smart technology into its operations. With KEENON Robotics' solutions, the hotel enhances operation efficiency while maintaining personalized service. Key innovations include: Smart Delivery Solutions: KEENON's DINERBOT and BUTLERBOT series manage meal delivery, table bussing, room service, guest guidance, and more. The BUTLERBOT, equipped with an elevator interface, enables smooth cross-floor delivery with enclosed cabins for increased hygiene and privacy, ensuring timely service. Smart Cleaning Solutions: The KLEENBOT C30 ensures a hygienic and comfortable environment by maintaining public areas with precision. Offering a 3-in-1 waterless cleaning solution, it efficiently sweeps, dust mops, and vacuums while operating quietly, making it an invaluable asset to the hotel's cleaning operations. Heavy Load Delivery Solution: The KEENON S100, with its heavy-duty capacity of over 100 kg, handles bulky items such as hotel linens, luggage, and supplies. It streamlines both back-of-house logistics and guest-facing deliveries, ensuring uninterrupted, end-to-end delivery for a seamless guest experience. Paving the Way for Smarter Hotel Operations The integration of smart technology at Furama Chiang Mai underscores the growing role of automation in the hospitality sector. With the global service robot market projected to reach $90 billion by 2030, hotels are increasingly turning to automation to improve service and management, aligning with Thailand's digital transformation goals. At the event, Mr. Wiraphong Ritrod, Deputy Governor of Chiang Mai Province, said, \"Partnerships like this between technology innovators and the hospitality sector set a strong example of how we can move forward together, making our city an even more attractive destination for tourists and investors.\" \"We are thrilled to support this transition to smart hospitality,\" said Mr. Bin Wan, COO of KEENON Robotics. \"Our solutions are designed to help optimize hotel operations while ensuring an elevated guest experience. This marks the beginning of a new era in smart hospitality.\" Thailand's tourism and hospitality sector is a key driver of the country's economy, and the introduction of smart hotel technology is expected to further boost its competitiveness on the global stage. The integration of KEENON Robotics' solutions aligns with Thailand's broader goals of embracing digital transformation and sustainable tourism.

Is today's world truly moving toward a multipolar order? How can the world ensure a healthy and stable transition to multipolarity? The answer to these critical questions concerns the stability of the international order and world peace and development. A multipolar world is both a historical inevitability and a reality. The Munich Security Report 2025, themed \"Multipolarization,\" states that today's world is characterized by \"multipolarization.\" This assessment aligns with the prevailing consensus in the international community. In international relations, \"pole\" refers to key influential political and economic forces in the global system. At its core, multipolarity is a global power and governance system featuring extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit. Since the Cold War ended in the early 1990s, the world has rapidly transitioned toward multipolarity. All countries and regions have increasingly sought a more independent and autonomous position in international affairs. Today, multipolarity is a direct reflection of the changing global power dynamics. According to the International Monetary Fund, emerging markets and developing economies contributed 58.9 percent to the global economy in 2023. The Munich Security Report 2025 highlights that BRICS nations account for about 40 percent of global trade and 40 percent of crude oil production and exports. This is not just about economic development - it is a basis for structural change in global order. The MSC saw 30 percent of its speakers this year representing the Global South, a testament to the world's multipolar trajectory. Global South countries are asserting greater independence in global affairs. They have actively promoted greater democracy in international relations through platforms such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, injecting vital momentum into the world multipolarization process. The report notes that multipolarization is not only evident in the diffusion of material power but also in the fact that the world has become more polarized ideologically. Developing nations have grown more self-assured in exploring the path to development independently. Together, the Global South is advocating for equal exchanges, inclusiveness and mutual learning among civilizations. A multipolar world better reflects the international community's aspirations for justice, fairness, and win-win cooperation. It aligns more closely with the realistic need for peace and development, and is more conducive to the reform of the global governance system. Increasing representation and voice of developing countries in global governance does not signify the \"decline of the West.\" Rather, it fosters a more balanced and cooperative international system and helps maintain the vitality of multilateralism in a multipolar world. Just as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres suggested, multipolarity promises to be \"a way to fix multilateralism.\" To prevent disorder and conflict during the transitional period in the international order, the key lies in working for an equal and orderly multipolar world. The international community should jointly advocate equal treatment, respect the international rule of law, practice true multilateralism, and pursue openness and mutual benefit. It should be a factor of certainty in the multipolar system, and strive to be steadfast constructive forces in a changing world. To build an equal and orderly multipolar world, rules must be followed. The purposes and principles of the UN Charter provide fundamental guidance for handling international relations, and an important cornerstone of a multipolar world. To build an equal and orderly multipolar world, views on cooperation must be updated with the times. One prominent concern about multipolarity is that it may lead to an inadequate supply of global public goods. To prevent this, nations must strike a balance between national and collective interests, and embrace a correct view of cooperation. By practicing true multilateralism, promoting extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit, and advancing a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, all parties can strengthen their ability to tackle challenges and pursue development with solid steps. The international community should seize this historic moment to shape an equal and orderly multipolar world. By prioritizing wisdom over fear, cooperation over confrontation, and rules over disorder, the world will move toward a brighter, more inclusive future.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-02-22 05:16:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_priority": 1333464, "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/en_prnasisa.png", "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top"], "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "3c45f2e5c056cf6b089106a5dafe1db4", "title": "Joshua Pacio Reflects On Decade-Long Evolution Following Comeback Victory At ONE 171: Qatar", "link": "https://menafn.com/1109237310/Joshua-Pacio-Reflects-On-Decade-Long-Evolution-Following-Comeback-Victory-At-ONE-171-Qatar", "keywords": null, "creator": ["marketing@menafn.com (MENAFN)"], "video_url": null, "description": "(MENAFN -
