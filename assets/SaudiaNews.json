"Images available here BALI, Indonesia, Feb. 6, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- FINNS Beach Club has officially launched and revealed Bali's first dedicated search and rescue helicopter with hoist capability, marking a major milestone in the island's emergency response infrastructure and reinforcing FINNS' long-term commitment to community safety. Made possible through funding and support from FINNS Beach Club, the helicopter will be operated by SGI (Sayap Garuda Indah), a Bali-based search and rescue organisation dedicated to saving lives across the island, significantly enhancing rescue readiness, response times, and operational capability across land and sea. BASARNASFINNS x SGI Helicopter The initiative has been developed in close collaboration with Indonesia's national search and rescue agency BASARNAS, confirming strong government support and a shared commitment to strengthening Bali's emergency response ecosystem, particularly in high-traffic coastal and tourism zones. Nusa Medica serves as the medical services partner providing medical assistance under the SAR collaboration between SGI and BASARNAS. As part of the collaboration, FINNS has also embedded a series of ongoing in-venue fundraising initiatives designed to help keep the helicopter operational and support SGI's lifesaving work long after launch. At the centre of this is a FINNS x SGI special fundraising menu, available across the venue, with 100% of proceeds directed to search and rescue operations. The menu features purpose-led guest experiences and signature drinks, including: The S.O.S Delivery \u2013 a premium bottle delivery experience featuring a custom shadow box message and bottle service, turning each table into a symbolic helipad moment. The \"What the Heli\" Delivery \u2013 an elevated bottle service experience with enhanced production, designed to create high-impact moments while contributing directly to rescue funding. FINNS x SGI Signature Cocktail: The High-Flyer \u2013 created exclusively for the partnership, with proceeds supporting helicopter operations. FINNS x SGI Shooter: Lemon Drop \u2013 available as single shots or shared formats, offering guests an easy way to contribute. Through this approach, FINNS is transforming everyday hospitality moments into tangible contributions toward emergency response capability. The helicopter and partnership are being officially unveiled through a landmark launch and media event hosted at FINNS Beach Club's Elite Rooftop Cabana. The event brings together FINNS, SGI, and BASARNAS, with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) taking place on the media day, confirming that BASARNAS is officially working hand in hand with SGI and fully supports the mission. The media event features a live simulated ocean rescue demonstration, with the helicopter performing a flyby and hoist operation, offering media and VIP guests a front-row view of the rescue capability and technology now being deployed in Bali. A panel discussion with representatives from FINNS, SGI, and BASARNAS will further explore the importance of public-private collaboration in strengthening safety outcomes for both locals and visitors, as well as the long-term vision for improving Bali's search and rescue ecosystem. \"Safety is fundamental to everything we do at FINNS,\" said Beau Whittington, CEO & Hospitality Leader, FINNS Global (Bali). \"Australians make up one of the largest visitor groups to Bali, and with that comes a responsibility to help ensure the island has strong, reliable rescue capability. We are proud to be funding and supporting this helicopter and to be working alongside SGI and BASARNAS to help protect both the local community and the many Australians who choose Bali as their second home.\" \"This partnership gives us greater capacity to respond quickly and effectively in emergency situations,\" said a spokesperson from SGI (Sayap Garuda Indah). \"The support from FINNS and the formal backing of BASARNAS directly strengthens our operational capability and allows us to save more lives.\" \"BASARNAS fully supports this collaboration and the shared mission to strengthen search and rescue capability in Bali,\" said a BASARNAS representative. \"Partnerships between government agencies, community organisations, and responsible private sector leaders like FINNS play an important role in enhancing national emergency response outcomes.\" Through this initiative, FINNS, SGI, and BASARNAS aim to set a new benchmark for how hospitality brands, community organisations, and government can work together to deliver meaningful, real-world impact.

China.org.cn on the wave of high-level interactions between China and Western countries in recent weeks: Western Leaders\u2019 Visits to China Gather Pace: in Search of New Hope First Canada, then Finland, followed by the United Kingdom \u2014 the opening of the new year has seen a peak in high-level engagement between Western developed countries and China. The recent visit to China by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer proved highly productive, during which the two countries recalibrated the direction of bilateral relations, resumed dialogues in various fields, and reached multiple areas of consensus to advance cooperation. China and the U.K. are steering back their relationship onto the right track with renewed momentum, leading to the broader wave of high-level interactions between China and Western countries seen in recent weeks. China has neither sought to court nor coerce these countries into taking its side; it has simply identified the right direction and stayed on course. A growing stream of Western countries are turning to this path with the gradual realization that China offers a place where countries can find the right direction and rediscover a sense of hope and possibility.
