inventory, and fraud \u2014 while only around 20% hold insurance policies that cover these. Attention to workplace safety and health (WSH) issues has slipped slightly, with less SMEs having return-to-work processes in place than last year, and fewer communicating their coverage and benefits to employees. The proportion of SMEs with a staff retention plan has notably increased, with flexible working key to keeping the best skilled staff. For the first time, this year's survey explored attitudes and approaches to older workers. Singapore SMEs are a major employer of workers aged 65 or older, with 41% saying their workforces are made up by 10% or more of this demographic. SINGAPORE, March 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- QBE Insurance today announced a second round of findings from this year's QBE Singapore SME Survey. Between December 2024 and January 2025, 600 decision-makers gave their views on a wide range of business risks and opportunities, including workplace safety and health (WSH), talent retention, and insurance-related issues, among others. A noteworthy finding from this year's edition is how most respondents have concerns about a wide range of businesses risks, yet very few hold insurance policies to protect their companies against the financial fallout from these. Some 74% of SME leaders are highly and moderately concerned about loss of income due to businesses interruption, yet only 23% hold an insurance policy for this risk. Likewise, 72% have high and moderate levels of concern for damage to or loss of inventory, while only 29% have an insurance policy that covers this. Similarly, 72% are highly and moderately concerned about fraud and fraudulent payments, but just 17% hold an associated insurance policy. \"Singapore's SME leaders are understandably concerned about a wide range of risks, yet the proportion of businesses that hold an insurance policy to meet these is low and somewhat surprising \u2014 especially given the financial consequences should these risks materialise,\" remarked Shun Quan Goh, Head, Underwriting, Retail & SME, QBE Singapore. 70% of this year's respondents said price is the number one consideration when purchasing insurance; and their second consideration was having insurance that helps the business to operate and serve customers better (68%). Last year, spending time and effort in choosing the right insurance policy for the business was most important (70%), followed by price concerns (67%). This pricing sensitivity is in line with a less than positive business outlook this year compared to last year shown by the respondents. \"Given today's uncertain economic conditions, it is no surprise that price is now the top concern of policyholders. This underscores the caution many SMEs have when it comes to expenditure and managing their company finances, even at the risk of being underinsured,\" added Mr. Goh. Attention to work safety remains high, while mental health attracts greater focus Attention to WSH issues remains high but has slipped slightly year-on-year. In 2024, 81% of respondents said they communicate coverage and benefits to their employees, versus 78% in 2025. While last year, 77% said they have return-to-work processes in place, versus 72% this year. Likewise in 2024, 70% said they are fully informed of work injury compensation (WIC) \u2014 insurance coverage that is compulsory under Singapore law \u2014 versus 66% in 2025. This year's low number of accidents may be behind these reductions: just 27% of businesses experienced between one and three WSH events over the past year. However, Singapore SMEs are notably upping their focus on mental health. Some 93% of respondents said it is either very important or somewhat important, up from 89% last year. More SMEs are also implementing measures to improve both mental and physical wellbeing as well, with 59% offering flexible working hours for improved work-life balance, up from 44% last year; and 45% offering work from home arrangements, rising from 35% in 2024. Talent and manpower retention; and high employability among older workers Almost half (49%) of respondents view talent and manpower as a key businesses challenge, rising from 37% in 2024. As such, many are exploring new ways to attract and retain workers. Flexible working is now the number one strategy for keeping the right and best staff, 51% of respondents said, versus 32% in 2024. Yet, heightened staff concerns aren't backed up with action: the number of SMEs who expect to make changes to their workforces in the next 12 months has declined. Some 46% expect changes in staff training, down from 52% a year earlier; while 36% expect to strengthen their staff, against 42% last year; with 40% expecting changes to the size of their business, down from 44% in 2024. For the first time, this year's survey explored attitudes and approaches to older workforces. Singapore SMEs are a noteworthy employer of this age group, the survey reveals, with 41% saying their workforces are made up by 10% or more of this demographic. Some 44% of respondents view this age group as experienced and skilled, with 39% believing them to be (more) loyal; and 31% describing them as stable. In Singapore, the employment rate for workers aged 65 has been increasing over the past decade and looks set to continue. In 2023, 9.2% of workers in Singapore were from this age group, according to government data[i]; and by 2030, some predict it will reach 10.6%[ii]. An older workforce may need more support from employers. While aging impacts individuals at different speeds, over time, response times may slow, people have less physical strength, and are potentially more vulnerable to illnesses than younger workers[iii], among other considerations. It is therefore critical that employers instil work policies that reflect these traits, as well as seek measures like insurance to future-proof risks that emanate from a changing workforce. Ronak Shah, CEO of QBE Singapore and CEO of Wholesale Markets Asia said, \"With over 70% of this age group in employment in Singapore[iv], workers aged 65 or over are an increasingly important part of Singapore's labour force. With so many companies focused on hiring the best staff, whatever their age group, this is highly encouraging. We will certainly be doing more in this space as this is a societal issue that insurers can play an active part in. It is also heartening to learn that other factors beyond pay are highly valued by SMEs and their employees, including work-life balance and work-from-home arrangements. These are all tangible benefits and changes that SMEs can make in having the best people help navigate through today's evolving risk landscape.\" For results of a similar survey conducted with Hong Kong SMEs, please visit this link.

Attention to workplace safety and health issues remains high, with more communicating their coverage and benefits to employees. The proportion of Hong Kong SMEs with a staff retention plan has notably increased, with increased pay the number one strategy for keeping staff. Hong Kong SMEs are a major employer of workers aged 65 or older, with 49% saying their workforces are made up by 10% or more of this demographic. HONG KONG, March 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- QBE Insurance today announced a second and final batch of key findings from this year's QBE Hong Kong SME Survey. Between November 2024 and January 2025, 600 Hong Kong business executives voiced their thoughts on multiple business risks and opportunities, including workplace safety and health (WSH), talent retention, and insurance-related issues, among others. A notable takeaway from this year's edition is how most business leaders have concerns about a wide range of businesses risks, yet very few hold insurance policies to protect their companies against these. For the second year running, anxiety over rising property rental prices was cited by 67% of respondents as the number one business concern, up from 64% in 2024. More interestingly however, was how 65% of businesses said that loss of income due to business interruption was a key business concern, while just 24% hold insurance policies to shield them from this risk. Similarly, 65% and 64% of respondents are concerned about the impact of losing staff and equipment malfunction respectively, with only 19% and 25% having insurance to cover these issues. \"Although we are seeing an increase in awareness of these risks, it is concerning that many SMEs are still underinsured,\" said Andex Fung, Head of SME Segment, Asia at QBE. \"Business owners should consider adequate protection against the full range of threats that can disrupt their operations. We understand that many SMEs have expressed concerns over increased costs and reduced profitability this year, but we would urge them to consider insurers like us as partners who can help businesses navigate these challenges \u2013 by offering advice and comprehensive risk management solutions tailored to their specific needs. Overall, the cost of not having the right coverage in place can be far greater than the investment in protection.\" An increased focus on work safety and mental health Attention to WSH is rising overall, this year's survey found. Some 92% of respondents said they communicate coverage and benefits to their employees, versus 90% last year. Similarly, 83% in 2025 said they are aware of employees' compensation insurance \u2014 coverage that is compulsory under Hong Kong law \u2014 with 76% saying the same in 2024. However, the number of businesses with return-to-work policies dropped slightly year-on-year, from 86% to 82%. And the proportion of Hong Kong SMEs that had experienced between one and three WSH events marginally rose from 22% in 2024 to 25% in 2025. Hong Kong SMEs remain focused on mental health. Some 95% of respondents said it is either very important or somewhat important, comparable to 94% last year. To this end, more SMEs are implementing measures to improve both mental and physical wellbeing, with 46% offering flexible working hours for improved work-life balance, up from 39% last year; and 40% offering work-from-home arrangements, rising from 28% in 2024. Talent acquisition and retention efforts remain high As the battle for top talent intensifies in Hong Kong, SMEs are placing more emphasis on recruitment, training, and retention. The survey revealed a marked increase in the percentage of SMEs concerned about these issues, with 50% of respondents identifying it as a key challenge, up from 39% in 2024. This rise demonstrates how talent management has become a growing priority for businesses striving to maintain competitiveness in a rapidly changing market. Increased pay and bonusses is key to keeping the best skilled staff in the business, with 43% of SMEs saying so, whereas the figure was just 29% last year. Flexible working arrangements have emerged as one of the most effective ways SMEs are tackling this challenge: the survey found that 39% of SMEs are offering flexible work schedules, a significant increase from 26% last year. Other measures aimed at enhancing employee satisfaction include the introduction of relaxation rooms or spaces for employees to recharge during work hours. For the first time, this year's survey explored attitudes and approaches to older workers. With employees aged 65 and over representing almost 14% of Hong Kong's workers[i], this demographic is an increasingly important part of the region's labour force. Hong Kong SMEs are a noteworthy employer of this age group, the survey reveals, with 49% saying their workforces are made up by 10% or more of this demographic. Some 34% of respondents view this age group as experienced and skilled, with 26% mentioning a higher retention rate and 25% asserting their loyalty. ### Notes to editor: For results of a similar survey conducted with Singapore SMEs, please visit this link.
