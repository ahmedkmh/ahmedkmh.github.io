Reviewers highlighted the 8 Constant+ Forest Environment System as a \"predictive health management system\" that uses metrics such as constant oxygen and constant cleanliness to proactively protect health\u2014reflecting the forward-looking concept of \"environment replacing medicine\". Meanwhile, the Omni-Smart Chain Ecosystem Technology System delivers a major advancement from single-point intelligence to full-home integration. Powered by a unified digital neural hub, it eliminates ecosystem silos between brands and protocols, reshaping the digital foundation of the smart home. One Heung Kong also partnered with nearly 100 premium brands from China, Germany, Switzerland, and Japan to co-develop the Omni-Smart Chain Ecosystem Technology System. The system enables open, full-protocol collaboration across multiple categories, including indoor air management and connected kitchen appliances. The approach not only delivers users a seamlessly integrated, AI-driven whole-home experience but also sets a new global standard for cooperation in the smart home industry. On August 24, at the closing ceremony of the 33rd Guangzhou Fair, the 11th International Exhibition of Inventions, and the Belt and Road & BRICS Skills Development and Technological Innovation Competition, One Heung Kong's 8 Constant+ Forest Environment System and Omni-Smart Chain Ecosystem Technology System were both awarded the Gold Prize. One Heung Kong's participation not only showcased the strength of Chinese technological innovation but also provided a forward-looking solution for the future of smart living\u2014contributing Chinese expertise to the global technology community.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-08-28 10:23:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://mma.prnasia.com/media2/2760084/Heungkong_Panasonic_TantronUnveil_Breakthrough_Forest_Ecology_Inspired_Indoor_Bionic_Technology.jpg?p=medium600", "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 4111305, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/en_prnasisa.png", "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top", "technology"], "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "ai_content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": true}], "nextPage": "1756376580241231858"}
