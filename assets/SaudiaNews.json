The company attributes this momentum to advanced domestic regulatory review in Korea, entry into an NSF-supported regenerative medicine ecosystem in the United States, secured commercialization capital, and a sizable open-market share purchase by the CEO. Key Strategic Updates Progressing through an advanced MFDS review of a precision-targeted ALS subgroup strategy in Korea Selected to participate in the NSF-supported U.S. regenerative medicine innovation engine KRW 26.1 billion in commercialization capital secured, supporting manufacturing readiness and global regulatory preparation Approximately KRW 1.7 billion open-market share purchase by the CEO, reinforcing management conviction and shareholder alignment Regulatory Progress and Commercial Readiness in Korea In Korea, Neuronata-R is undergoing a product license modification review by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS). Following mixed efficacy results in the overall patient population in the Phase 3 ALSUMMIT trial, CorestemChemon refined its regulatory strategy to focus on a clinically defined \"slow progressor\" subgroup. Post-hoc analyses in this subgroup showed clinically meaningful and internally consistent signals, including maintenance of ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) scores, stabilization of slow vital capacity (SVC), and favorable trends in neurofilament light chain (NfL) biomarkers. The company believes these findings have supported a more structured and focused regulatory dialogue with the MFDS. The company expects this precision-targeted approach to further clarify the domestic regulatory pathway, while preserving the option for initial commercialization upon potential approval. A favorable MFDS decision would enable domestic market entry and generation of real-world evidence (RWE), which could support future global regulatory strategies. The company expects a final regulatory decision in Korea before the first quarter of 2026. Entry into NSF-Supported U.S. Regenerative Medicine Ecosystem CorestemChemon has been selected to join the Piedmont Triad Regenerative Medicine Innovation Engine, a U.S. regional innovation cluster supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The company stated that it is the first Korean biotechnology firm to be included in an NSF-backed regenerative medicine ecosystem. The selection was initiated by the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine (WFIRM), which cited the scientific robustness of Neuronata-R's Phase 3 clinical dataset and the consistency observed in long-term real-world follow-up data. Participation in the NSF Engine is expected to provide access to translational research capabilities, manufacturing resources, and a broader regulatory network. To align more closely with this ecosystem, CorestemChemon plans to relocate its U.S. subsidiary to North Carolina. The company intends to leverage the cluster as a platform for regulatory engagement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), targeting submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) in the third quarter of 2026. Commercialization Funding and Financial Position To support commercialization readiness following potential domestic approval, CorestemChemon recently completed a rights offering, raising KRW 26.1 billion in operating capital (approximately USD 17.8 million, based on recent exchange rates). The proceeds are allocated to upgrading production facilities, establishing commercial-scale manufacturing systems, and preparing for both domestic and global regulatory processes. The company expects the capital raise to strengthen its financial position and reduce execution risk associated with manufacturing scale-up and regulatory preparation, while addressing near-term funding concerns. CEO Share Purchase Reinforces Management Conviction In a move widely interpreted as reinforcing market confidence, CEO Yang Gil-ahn recently executed a large-scale open-market share purchase. Over a two-week period, he acquired more than one million shares, representing an investment of approximately KRW 1.7 billion (approximately USD 1.2 million, based on recent exchange rates). The purchase coincided with the submission of supplementary regulatory materials to the MFDS and is viewed as a signal of management's conviction at a key regulatory inflection point. Following the transaction, the combined ownership stake of the controlling shareholder group increased to 10.32%, further strengthening alignment between management and shareholders. Outlook With continued domestic regulatory progress, secured commercialization capital, and a defined U.S. regulatory pathway supported by NSF-backed infrastructure, CorestemChemon is positioning Neuronata-R to transition from late-stage development toward initial market entry and real-world evidence generation. The company expects these milestones to support broader global expansion and long-term value creation.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["mtc", "bio", "hea"], "creator": null, "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["technology", "top"], "datatype": "news", "pubDate": "2025-12-18 02:31:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 4111305, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/en_prnasisa.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": true}, {"article_id": "ffaae4a9164327f35c4e3585068a6455", "link": "https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/4154253", "title": "\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0641\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0627\u0654\u0634\u062e\u0627\u0635 \u0630\u0648\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0655\u0639\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0628\u0646\u0627\u062f\u0649 \u0633\u0628\u0648\u0631\u062a\u064a\u0646\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636\u064a", "description": "\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0636\u0627\u0641 \u0646\u0627\u062f\u0649 \u0633\u0628\u0648\u0631\u062a\u064a\u0646\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636\u0649 \u0641\u0639\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0627\u0654\u0634\u062e\u0627\u0635 \u0630\u0648\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0655\u0639\u0627\u0642\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0649 \u0646\u0638\u0645\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0644\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0645\u0649 \u0644\u0644\u0627\u0654\u0634\u062e\u0627\u0635 \u0630\u0648\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0655\u0639\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0639 \u0644\u062c\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0655\u0639\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629 2451 -\u0645\u0635\u0631\u060c \u0648\u0646\u0627\u062f\u0649 \u0631\u0648\u062a\u0627\u0631\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0655\u0633...", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0644\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0645\u064a \u0644\u0630\u0648\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0627\u0642\u0629"], "creator": ["\u0623\u0645\u0644 \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633"], "language": "arabic", "country": ["israel", "yemen", "iraq", "kuwait", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "libya", "jordan"], "category": ["sports"], "datatype": "news", "pubDate": "2025-12-18 02:30:42", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://mediaaws-live.almasryalyoum.com/almasryalyoum/uploads/images/2025/12/18/1506726.webp", "video_url": null, "source_id": "almasryalyoum", "source_name": "Al-masry Al-youm", "source_priority": 3417, "source_url": "https://www.almasryalyoum.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/almasryalyoum.jpg", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "d2ea66b827c0bdda5acaa1bc8920c2f5", "link": "https://menafn.com/1110496321/Randeep-Hooda-Reveals-What-He-Really-Does-During-Jungle-Safaris", "title": "Randeep Hooda Reveals What He Really Does During Jungle Safaris", "description": "(MENAFN -

The Company plans to initiate a clinical study of JSKN027 for the treatment of advanced malignant solid tumors. JSKN027 is a first-in-class bispecific ADC designed to co-engage PD-L1 and VEGFR2. By leveraging glycan-specific conjugation technology, it precisely links its cleavable linker and topoisomerase I inhibitor payload to the antibody's Fc region \u2013 maintaining a strong safety profile while unlocking potent anti-tumor activity. JSKN027's efficacy stems from a unique three-fold synergistic mechanism. Beyond the standard ADC effects of targeted cell killing and bystander activity, it also inhibits tumor angiogenesis by blocking VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling and reverses immune suppression by disrupting the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint. This integrated attack enhances overall anti-tumor power and is anticipated to help overcome therapeutic resistance. Preclinical data has demonstrated that JSKN027 exhibits potent anti-tumor activity in both in vitro and in vivo models. IND enabling tox study demonstrated good tolerability at highest dose. With combination of targeted chemo, anti-angiogenesis and IO, JSKN027 represents a promising treatment strategy across solid tumors. This Phase I clinical study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD), and antitumor activity of JSKN027 in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors, and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D).
