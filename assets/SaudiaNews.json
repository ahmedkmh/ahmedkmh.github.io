"description": "Maximizes efficiency in autonomous driving training data processing with SVDataFlow-based integrated data management system SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- STRADVISION, a leader in deep learning-based vision perception technology for the automotive industry, today announced the release of SVDataFlow, an advanced version of the \"Data Management Workflow\" first introduced at CES 2025. This upgrade, developed as part of the company's Digital Transformation 2.0 strategy, strengthens automation and optimization capabilities for large-scale 3D training data processing and secures scalability through hybrid cloud services. SVDataFlow: An Integrated Pipeline Connecting Data Collection to Analysis SVDataFlow is a comprehensive data management pipeline that automates the entire process for autonomous driving and ADAS development, from sensor data collection and ingestion to preprocessing, labeling, verification, and final analysis. Key features include: SURF Recording System: Synchronizes camera, LiDAR, radar, and vehicle CAN signals to ensure high-quality data. AI-based Time Correction: Refines sensor timestamps for improved alignment of images and point clouds. Auto-Labeling Engine & Auto-Sampling: Automatically labels large datasets and selects samples that directly contribute to model improvement. Web Labeling Tool (Labelit) + ALAS: Supports semi-automatic labeling with pre-trained labels, reducing repetitive tasks and improving efficiency. Quality Verification Network & WLS/WRS: Automatically validates and analyzes labeling quality, minimizing error rates and optimizing data reuse. With this upgrade, STRADVISION has also secured scalability based on a hybrid cloud architecture that combines on-premise and cloud infrastructure. This design enables flexible responses to customer requirements: cloud resources can be expanded immediately for large-scale data processing, while projects with strict security regulations can be supported with on-premise operations to ensure compliance and stability. Through the introduction of SVDataFlow, STRADVISION has already demonstrated significant benefits, including faster 3D data processing, a 30-40% improvement in labeling efficiency, and a noticeable reduction in operational costs. Notably, optimization of ALAS (Auto-Labeling Assistant Service) 3D map loading has significantly eased the workload of global operators. \"SVDataFlow is more than a data pipeline; it is a comprehensive management system that achieves balance across quality, productivity, efficiency, and scalability,\" said Insu Kim, Head of STRADVISION's Data Innovation Center. \"We plan to commercialize SVDataFlow by the end of 2025, expand it into SVDataFlow as a Service in 2026, and roll it out globally. Through Digital Transformation 2.0, we will work with our customers to lead the global autonomous driving market.\" For more information on STRADVISION and its industry-leading technologies, please visit STRADVISION.

From his 34-year tenure as Head of Design at Braun to his projects with Vits\u0153, the furniture company he co-founded in 1959, Dieter Rams is widely regarded as one of the most influential design voices of the 20th century, having set new standards for clarity, functionality and timelessness in design. His Ten Principles of Good Design have guided generations of designers, influencing everything from household products to digital interfaces, and continue to serve as a touchstone for design that is both human-centred and enduring. \"Few designers have left a mark as indelible as Dieter Rams. His unwavering and long-standing commitment to design integrity have not only shaped the objects around us, but also the very values of our profession,\" stated WDO President Thomas Garvey. \"As laureate of this year's World Design Medal, WDO is honoured to recognize his ongoing legacy, one that continues to challenge, inspire and elevate designers around the world.\" Following a public call for nominations, Rams was selected by the World Design Medal Selection Committee. The committee, composed of members of WDO's Board of Directors and Senators, acknowledged Rams' lifetime of contributions that have redefined the standards of design practice. Reflecting on this designation, Dieter Rams shared that \"internationality has always been very important to me. Only through free, honest and collegial international dialogue and cooperation will we be able to shape our world sensibly in the future.\" The World Design Medal 2025 presentation took place on 9 September 2025 as part of the World Design Congress programme in London (UK). The award was accepted on Dieter Rams' behalf by Prof. Dr. Klaus Klemp, Managing Director of the Dieter and Ingeborg Rams Foundation.
