Australia PMET Resources Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"PMET\") (TSX: PMET) (ASX: PMT) (OTCQX: PMETF) (FSE: R9GA) is pleased to announce it has filed on SEDAR+ a technical report (the \"Technical Report\"), prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). The Technical Report is titled \"CV5 Pegmatite Lithium-Only Feasibility Study NI 43-101 Technical Report \u2013 Shaakichiuwaanaan Project\", with an Issue Date of November 14, 2025, and Effective Date of October 20, 2025. The filing follows the October 20, 2025, news release by the Company announcing a positive lithium-only Feasibility Study (\"FS\") on the CV5 Pegmatite outlining the potential for a large-scale mining operation at the Shaakichiuwaanaan Project. The Technical Report has been prepared by G Mining Services Inc., with contributions from Primero Group Americas Inc., AtkinsRe\u0301alis Group Inc., BBA Inc., Paterson & Cooke Canada Inc., Vision Geochemistry Ltd., Alius Mine Consulting, WSP Global Inc., Mailloux Hydroge\u0301ologie and GCM Expert, each consulting groups independent of the Company, in accordance with NI 43-101. The report is available on SEDAR+ and will be available shortly thereafter on the Company's website. Readers are encouraged to read the FS Technical Report in its entirety, including all qualifications, assumptions, exclusions and risks that relate to the Mineral Resource, Mineral Reserve, and life of mine plan. The FS Technical Report is intended to be read as a whole, and sections should not be read or relied upon out of context. About PMET Resources Inc. PMET Resources Inc. is a pegmatite critical mineral exploration and development company focused on advancing its district-scale 100%-owned Shaakichiuwaanaan Property located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec, Canada, which is accessible year-round by all-season road and proximal to regional hydro-power infrastructure. In late 2025, the Company announced a positive lithium-only Feasibility Study on the CV5 Pegmatite (the \"Feasibility Study\") and declared a maiden Mineral Reserve of 84.3 Mt at 1.26% Li2O (Probable)1. The study outlines the potential for a competitive and globally significant high-grade lithium project targeting up to ~800 ktpa spodumene concentrate using a simple Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") only process flowsheet. Further, the results highlight Shaakichiuwaanan as a potential North American critical mineral powerhouse with significant opportunity for tantalum and caesium in addition to lithium. ____________________________________ 1 See Feasibility news release dated October 20, 2025. Probable Mineral Reserve cut-off grade is 0.40% Li2O (open-pit) and 0.70% Li2O (underground). Underground development and open-pit marginal tonnage containing material above 0.37% Li2O are also included in the statement. Effective Date of September 11, 2025. The Project hosts a Consolidated Mineral Resource2 totalling 108.0 Mt at 1.40% Li2O and 166 ppm Ta2O5 (Indicated), and 33.4 Mt at 1.33% Li2O and 155 ppm Ta2O5 (Inferred), and ranks as the largest3 lithium pegmatite resource in the Americas, and in the top ten globally. Additionally, the Project hosts the world's largest pollucite-hosted caesium pegmatite Mineral Resource at the Rigel and Vega zones with 0.69 Mt at 4.40% Cs2O (Indicated), and 1.70 Mt at 2.40% Cs2O (Inferred).
