In 2024, the company invested 165 million Euros in environmental-related investments and expenditures. Today, low-carbon products generate for more than 70% of total revenue, while energy-efficient appliances continue to make up a significant portion of this share. Material efficiency initiatives embedded in product design delivered savings of more than 17,000 tonnes. Circularity is further strengthened through the use of over 27,800 tonnes of recycled plastics across manufacturing in 2024. In parallel, Beko scaled up its refurbishment activities, extending the life of more than 114,000 appliances in 2024 through its global refurbishment network. \"Our recognition in the Corporate Knights Global 100, alongside our leadership rankings from S&P Global, CDP, and EcoVadis, confirms that sustainability sits at the core of how we design, invest, and grow our business across the markets we operate. Together, these outcomes validate our commitment and prove that scale and innovation, when guided by responsibility, can deliver measurable impact for society, the economy, and our planet.\" said Hakan Bulgurlu, CEO of Beko.
