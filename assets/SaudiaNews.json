integrated, tailored guest experiences and digital partnerships are helping Thai hotels stand out amid rising regional travel SINGAPORE, Feb. 4, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital travel platform Agoda, in its latest \"Tailored to Win: How Hotels are using Localization to Capture Asia's Tourism Boom\" report focuses on Thailand, revealing that 92% of hotels engaging in early stages of localization strategies are seeing higher guest spend as intra-Asia travel accelerates. The survey found that hotels that are moving beyond standard hospitality and investing in tailored guest experiences may be gaining a competitive edge in an increasingly diverse and dynamic market. Drawing more than 35 million visitors annually and home to more than 17,000 hotels nationwide[1], Thailand remains as a regional tourism hotspot and a key hub for intra-Asia travel. The steady inflow of regional visitors, particularly from neighboring Asian markets, is shaping the landscape for accommodation providers. To stand out in this increasingly competitive environment, hotels are adapting their strategies to reflect the specific cultural, linguistic and practical preferences of inbound travelers from respective markets. Agoda's report shows that one in four Thai hotels now offer a seamlessly localized journey, with 25% at the \"integrated tailoring\" stage wherein hotels offer a fully localized experience that reflects deep cultural understanding across marketing, booking and on-site touchpoints. Localization strategies go beyond translation, encompassing marketing, booking processes, payment options and guest services tailored to the preferences of each source market. This approach to localization is reflected in how hotels tailor their offerings for different guest segments and preferences. Based on insights from the Agoda Travel Outlook report: Malaysian travelers prioritize value for money and family-friendly options Chinese guests seek authentic Thai experiences from food to massages and de\u0301cor South Korean guests prefer long-stay offers and listings that highlight local food and attractions Indian travelers value wellness and adventure partnerships \"Thailand welcomes over 33 million visitors each year and the hotels capturing the most value are those going beyond standard hospitality,\" said Akaporn Rodkong (Looknum), Country Director, Thailand at Agoda. \"Deep localization - such as adapting payments, language and service to each market - can not only lead to stronger performance but also enable partners to better meet guest expectations. Hotels adopting a more data-driven approach and taking the first steps towards localization are already noticing that some guests are more willing to up their spend during stays. They report seeing positive outcomes from pairing competitive pricing with experiences that truly resonate with guests, often starting long before they even arrive at the property.\" Agoda's digital suite for localization includes over 6 million accommodations, support for 39 languages, multi-currency payment options and 24/7 customer support. Dedicated programs such as the Agoda Growth Program for visibility in priority markets, country-specific promotions and Agoda Media Solutions for native-language campaigns are just some of the ways Agoda helps partners localize effectively. Through Agoda's platform and expertise, hotels can overcome barriers, reach new segments and optimize their returns from international demand.

The programme is aligned with Singapore's SkillsFuture and Smart Nation priorities, which emphasise building AI skills and strengthening data-driven decision-making capabilities across the workforce. As AI becomes central to how organisations operate, demand for AI-related skills continues to grow, with companies across Asia-Pacific increasingly adopting AI tools and integrating AI into workflows and operating models. \"The real AI skills gap isn't merely technical\u2014it's translational,\" said Professor Sungjong Roh, Academic Director of the Master of Science in Business AI at SMU. \"While organisations may have access to AI tools, far fewer have leaders and executives who know how to work with them strategically, deploy them responsibly, and ensure they create value while effectively managing risk. This programme closes that critical gap.\" Building a pool of business leaders who can lead with AI By cultivating a cadre of socially conscious business leaders prepared to take on strategic roles in AI-enabled organisations, the Master of Science in Business and AI programme reflects SMU's vision for innovation in education. Developed in close alignment with industry needs, the programme aims to nurture graduates who are fluent in the language of AI technologies and, more importantly, adept in managerial decision-making, business acumen, and strategic transformation within an AI-driven economy. Unlike traditional programmes that focus either on technical AI development or general management training, SMU's Master of Science in Business AI is explicitly business-first. The programme emphasises practical leadership and strategic application, and differentiates itself in three key ways: Integrated interdisciplinarity: Business strategy, decision intelligence, AI capabilities, and ethics are taught as an integrated whole rather than as siloed disciplines. Students learn to operate at the intersection of senior leadership and technical teams\u2014a capability increasingly demanded by industry. Practice-oriented and interactive learning: The curriculum includes distinctive courses such as Human\u2013AI Collaboration, Data Storytelling and AI-Augmented Influencing, Change Management for Disruptive AI, and Innovations and Operations in Intelligent Online Marketplaces. SMU's hallmark interactive, seminar-style pedagogy fosters deep engagement, peer learning, and close integration with industry practice. Strong alignment with national and industry needs: The programme directly supports Singapore's SkillsFuture and Smart Nation priorities by building capabilities in Business Intelligence, AI-enabled decision-making, and responsible AI governance\u2014areas critical to sustaining competitiveness in an AI-augmented economy. With strong industry linkages in Singapore and across Asia, SMU aims for the programme to contribute directly to the nation's pipeline of AI-ready business leaders. By developing \"bridge builders\" who can connect senior leadership with technical teams and ensure AI investments translate into business value, the University continues to support Singapore's ambition to remain competitive in an AI-driven global economy. Applications for the Master of Science in Business and Artificial Intelligence are open from today for the August 2026 intake.
