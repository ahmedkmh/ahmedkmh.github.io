Under this agreement, both TIP and ICE will create co-branded indices, expanding the range of solutions available to Taiwan's financial ecosystem. TIP's indices under this arrangement will utilize fixed income indices administered by ICE. The first blended index to be launched under the agreement is the \"ICE TIP Dual-Core Balanced Multi-Asset Index\", administered by TIP. This index is created by combining the \"TIP Customized Taiwan Large-Cap Representatives 25 Index\" and the \"ICE 10+ Year BBB US Corporate Yield-Weighted Constrained Index TWD 3pm Taipei\". This new multi-asset index is designed to be one with global reach and asset diversification that can be used in a passive fund for domestic investors. It illustrates the strategic value of the agreement \u2014 seamlessly combining TIP's deep expertise in Taiwanese equities with ICE's capabilities in fixed income indices. TIP and ICE have also agreed to implement a co-branding arrangement under which each party may distribute its indices through a shared branding program. Seeking to leverage ICE's global footprint and fixed income expertise, TIP will continue to capitalise on its affiliation with the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) to support and streamline the listing of ETPs on the exchange, strengthening the value of Taiwan's capital market. Sherman Lin, Chairman of TIP, said: \"We believe that our strong complementary agreement will be a valuable addition to contribute meaningfully to index innovation both in Taiwan and globally, helping to drive the next wave of index development. TIP will continue to serve as a reliable partner to domestic asset managers by leveraging group resources and exploring index licensing opportunities through the co-branding arrangement.\" Varun Pawar, Chief Product Officer at ICE, said, \"Taiwan's ETF market is entering an exciting new phase with the introduction of multi-asset indices, providing investors with broader diversification. Our collaboration with TIP and TIP's launch of the ICE TIP Dual-Core Balanced Multi-Asset Index reflect our shared commitment to innovation and to supporting issuers in delivering products that meet evolving investor needs. As Taiwan grows as a regional asset management hub, we're proud to contribute our global insights and data expertise to deliver solutions that create opportunity for investors.\" About Taiwan Index Plus Corporation Established in 2016, TIP is a professional index and information services provider wholly-owned by TWSE.
