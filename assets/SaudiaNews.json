Panduit, a leading global manufacturer of high-quality electrical and network infrastructure, launched the APAC Skills Change Lives Campaign in response to rising youth unemployment and a growing skills mismatch in the Asia-Pacific region \u2014an issue magnified in the post-COVID digital economy. Through strategic partnerships with educational institutions, industry leaders, and government agencies, Panduit empowers students with vocational education, technical training, and real-world experience to thrive in a fast-evolving job market. The campaign began in Singapore and has since expanded to China and Japan, creating sustainable opportunities for youths across the region. The initiative is built on four key pillars: technical training centres, online learning platforms, skills competitions, and internships. Notable efforts include two state-of-the-art labs at ITE College East in Singapore, a simulated data center at Shanghai Zhonghua Vocational School, and support for youth skills forums in Japan. Students benefit from industry-relevant instruction, real-world experience, and access to Panduit's online learning platform. The program also sponsors major skills competitions such as WorldSkills Singapore and WorldSkills ASEAN, giving students opportunities to gain national recognition and boost their career readiness. -more- \"We are honored to receive the AREA 2025 award.
