Participating in the roundtable discussion on \"Opportunities and Challenges for Women in Economic Transition,\" Song Tingting, Vice President of Kuaishou Technology and Chairperson of the Kuaishou Public Welfare Foundation, shared how the Company is leveraging its platform and digital tools to help women gain visibility, unlock new economic opportunities, and take on greater roles in the digital economy. Song Tingting (second from right), Vice President of Kuaishou, speaks on empowering women through economic transition at the 2025 China-Germany Sustainable Development Forum in Beijing. Song noted that in today's economic shift, digital technology is emerging as one of the most powerful forces enabling women to participate more fully in growth opportunities. \"In the past, much of women's value remained hidden, especially for those living in remote areas,\" said Song. \"Kuaishou's mission is to break down these invisible barriers, so that women can be seen, recognized, and empowered to realize their potential on our platform. This is what inclusive technology truly means.\" Since 2018, Kuaishou has launched a series of public welfare programs such as \"Happy Rural Leaders,\" \"Her Power Academy,\" and \"Empowering for Happiness.\" These initiatives provide free digital skills training and basic equipment to women in rural and underserved communities. As of today, Kuaishou has trained more than 10,000 women leaders and enabled millions of women to improve their income, achieve economic independence, and enhance their livelihoods. \"In today's economic transition, the challenges women face are real,\" Song said. \"But digital technology is gradually becoming a powerful tool to overcome these challenges.\" She noted that with the right training and access to tools, women are transforming from marginalized participants into essential contributors to rural revitalization and economic growth. One example is Zhang Xiaosi, a Kuaishou user from Shandong Province who returned home to care for her ill father. With free training and livestreaming support provided by Kuaishou, she started selling local cherries online and saw her sales grow more than 36-fold, earning more than 80,000 yuan. Her success also boosted the income of elderly villagers and earned her a seat as a deputy in the local People's Congress. \"Technology is a tool. Kindness is a choice,\" said Song. \"We believe that empowering one woman means empowering a family, and even an entire village. That is the true meaning of tech for good.\" Despite the progress, Song pointed out that women still face two major barriers: balancing family responsibilities with career advancement, and bridging the digital divide, particularly in remote areas with limited access to tools and information. She called for broader support across international, national, corporate, and individual levels. Looking ahead, Song proposed stronger collaboration between China and Germany to support women in the digital economy. She suggested co-developing a bilateral training system to cultivate women leaders in digital commerce, sustainability, and entrepreneurship, combining China's experience in digital platform operations with Germany's strengths in vocational education and sustainable development. She also advocated for an exchange platform connecting female entrepreneurs from both countries to foster mutual learning and collaboration. Kuaishou remains committed to partnering globally to advance inclusive digital transformation, reduce inequality, and support the long-term development of women through accessible technology.

search firm, and Lewis Sanders, a leading legal and compliance recruitment consultancy, have combined forces as part of the next step in their strategic journey. The merger will create a unified entity that will offer a full-service legal recruitment platform for private practice and in-house clients. The firm, operating under the name Ropner Lewis Sanders, combines the deep sector expertise, market intelligence, and client-centric approach of both organisations. The businesses were established in Hong Kong and are still founder-led, with extensive networks and expertise in the Asia market. This strategic move positions the firm as one of the region's foremost legal recruitment consultancies, with a unique offering of both law firm and in-house roles. Founded in 2016, Ropner Search has built a strong reputation for precision placements for both teams and individuals in private practice, with a focus on M&A, capital markets, banking & finance, dispute resolution and energy & infrastructure. Outside the legal sector, Ropner Search also has an excellent track record with select private capital, asset management and hedge fund clients. Lewis Sanders, established in 2006, has a well-established record as one of Hong Kong's leading legal recruitment consultancies, placing lawyers and professional support professionals at all levels at international law firms as well as global investment banks, financial institutions, regulators, MNCs, and Hong Kong-listed companies. Angus Ropner will assume the role of Managing Partner, while Lindsey Sanders will continue as Director and Emily Lewis as an Advisor. \"This merger is a step change in our operations and ideally positions us to take advantage of the rapidly growing market in Hong Kong and Asia as a whole\" said Angus Ropner, Managing Partner of Ropner Lewis Sanders. \"By joining forces, we are greatly amplifying our ability to serve clients and candidates with more agility, insight, and scale. The financial and professional services industries in Hong Kong are booming, particularly in capital markets, M&A and alternatives such as private equity and private credit, and that is creating a renewed demand for legal hiring at every level. By covering both in-house and private practice hiring solutions within one business, we can offer the most comprehensive support in the market.\" Lindsey Sanders, Director at Ropner Lewis Sanders, added, \"Our combined networks and complementary strengths will allow us to deliver even more strategic and tailored recruitment solutions. We are hugely excited to embark on this journey with Ropner Search and by the possibilities the combination creates for our firms and for our clients. Both firms have been founded in Hong Kong and have maintained long standing relationships with candidates and clients both in-house and in private practice. Our combined expertise, knowledge and relationships makes us one of the best-positioned firms in the market not just in Hong Kong but in the region.\" The merger will see the integration of both teams into a single office at One Chinachem Central, with a unified leadership structure and enhanced service offerings. The business has already started trading and clients can expect a seamless transition, with continued access to trusted advisors as well as the benefit of expanded resources. Ropner Lewis Sanders will continue to focus on high-quality placements from junior to partner level, while expanding its footprint in compliance, business support, and legal operations recruitment, as well as the asset management, private capital and hedge fund industries. The firm will also invest in technology and data-driven tools to enhance candidate sourcing and market analysis.
