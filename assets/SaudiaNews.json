The presentation will deliver the latest clinical data to leading global experts in the fields of respiratory and infectious diseases. SNS812 is the world's first fully modified siRNA drug, clinically validated and administered via aerosol inhalation, demonstrating potent and broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Results from a Phase II clinical trial show that SNS812 significantly reduces viral load, accelerates the resolution of key symptoms such as shortness of breath, and effectively shortens the recovery time of smell and taste loss. These results indicate a strong potential for preventing severe disease progression and offering neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, SNS812 has shown excellent safety and tolerability, with no serious adverse events reported, making it a promising candidate as an inhalable broad-spectrum COVID-19 therapy. The presentation will be delivered in a Mini Symposium, the highest-tier session format at the ATS conference. This premier session is reserved for studies demonstrating exceptional scientific originality, clinical significance, and contributions to global health, and inclusion requires rigorous scientific review. The selection of SNS812 affirms the international recognition of Oneness Biotech and Microbio (Shanghai) for their technological platform in nucleic acid drug development and their innovative capabilities in precision antiviral therapy.
