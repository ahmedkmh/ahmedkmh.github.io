(NYSE American: MPU) launched seven English mini-series on its short drama platform FlexTV between May 19 and May 23, 2025, each illuminating life's myriad vicissitudes. Through tales of emotional entanglement, familial upheaval, social barriers, and fateful turning points, audiences witnessed love's sweetness and sorrow, betrayal's pain and enlightenment, and the fervor and hope of triumph against the odds. Desire Maze Forced to Love the Ruthless CEO (May 19)Mega Matrix Inc.'s FlexTV introduced \"Forced to Love the Ruthless CEO,\" in which college student Nina enters a forbidden pact with CEO Ian to fund her mother's surgery, only to reunite with her former lover Evan in a hospital corridor. As an artificial kidney becomes the pivot of a deadly love triangle, every embrace conceals ulterior motives and every tear carries a price. Hands Off, Hearts On (May 20)FlexTV then premiered \"Hands Off, Hearts On,\" where martial-arts heiress Emily collides with business magnate Alexander in a fateful car accident. When Emily's sister impersonates her savior, the story subverts the typical \"stand-in\" trope. Filmed in real locations, the rain-soaked fight scenes showcase authentic kung-fu choreography and an Eastern aesthetic of strength. Wrong Man, Right Love (May 23)Finally in this block, \"Wrong Man, Right Love\" features a ludicrous case of mistaken abduction thrusting a faux playboy heir into the spotlight, exposing his survival instincts beneath a gilded fac\u0327ade. From bed-bound bindings to boardroom battles, the protagonists spark darkly humorous sparks amid their identity confusion. Ethical Dilemmas Code Red: Love's Last Call (May 19)On May 19, FlexTV rolled out \"Code Red: Love's Last Call,\" in which Dr. Ethan faces his marriage's final reckoning with three life-or-death choices, spotlighting the modern struggle to \"cut losses\" in intimate relationships. When his wife Claire diverts life-saving funds to her first love, the series provokes profound debate on emotional coercion and the limits of responsibility. From Trash to Throne (May 21)On May 21, \"From Trash to Throne\" dramatizes the story of disinherited scion Ethan, whose birthright is usurped by his adopted son. As evidence of a mansion fire surfaces in three stages, he transforms from victim to judge, unmasking the hypocrisy within his own bloodline. Breakthrough Manual Lady of Logic, Lover of War (May 21)Also on May 21, FlexTV released \"Lady of Logic, Lover of War,\" where Diana's divorce is waged not with vengeance but with M&A strategy to reclaim her family's empire. Paralleling a restaurant takeover with clashes against warlord factions, the drama underscores the strategic depth of a female disruptor. Life 2.0: Loser Reloaded (May 22)On May 22, \"Life 2.0: Loser Reloaded\" follows laborer Ryan's resurrection, defying conventional \"cheat-code\" arcs. By upgrading his flip phone and rewriting his destiny, the narrative embodies the tangible pursuit of social mobility. The brotherhood of the construction site lends the story authenticity and heart. When Drama Mirrors the Struggle for SurvivalMega Matrix Inc.'s FlexTV highlights how deals struck beside the operating theater reflect moral quandaries born of unequal resources; a marriage countdown lays bare the critical threshold for \"loss-limitation\" in love; on the worksite, it is not only phones that ascend but barriers to class mobility; and in the gilded halls of privilege, it is blood and power\u2014rather than brick and mortar\u2014that burn with the fiercest conflicts. Available in 15 languages including English, Japanese, and Korean, FlexTV reaches viewers in over 100 countries and regions. As it continues to innovate and diversify its content offerings, FlexTV remains committed to providing a premium viewing experience for audiences around the world.

Key Metrics The numbers for our key metrics, which include our period active users (PAU), period paying users (PPU), average membership and top-up streaming service revenue per active user (ARPU), and average membership and top-up streaming service revenue per paying user (ARPPU), are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. We define an active user as a user who has downloaded and opened the FlexTV app at least once. We define a paying user as a user who has registered for a membership or has topped up, provided a method of payment, and is entitled to access FlexTV services (this membership or topping up does not include participation in free trials or other promotional offers extended by FlexTV to new users). We define ARPU as average membership and top-up streaming services revenue generated by each active user in one quarter. We define ARPPU as average membership and top-up streaming services revenue generated by each paying user in one quarter. We use these metrics to assess the growth and health of the overall business and believe that ARPU best reflects our ability to attract, retain, engage and monetize our users, and thereby drive revenue. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in technology or our methodology.
