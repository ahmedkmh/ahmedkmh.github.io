Total net revenues rose to RMB3.36 billion, up 10.8% year over year. Transaction service revenue remained a core growth engine, increasing 39.0% year over year to RMB1.46 billion. We also propelled ecosystem development, leveraging user experience enhancements to drive high-quality growth. In addition, our acquisition of a majority interest in Giga.AI Technology Limited, previously known as Plus PRC Holding Ltd. (\"Giga.AI\"), strengthened our AI capabilities and technological foundation, positioning us to seize new growth opportunities and accelerate the platform's long-term development.\" [1] Non-GAAP adjusted net income is defined as net income excluding (i) share-based compensation expense; (ii) amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions; (iii) compensation cost incurred in relation to acquisitions; and (iv) tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments.

[2] Fulfilled orders on our platform in a given period are defined as all shipping orders matched through our platform during such period but exclude (i) shipping orders that are subsequently canceled and (ii) shipping orders for which our users failed to specify any freight prices, as there are substantial uncertainties as to whether such shipping orders are fulfilled. [3] Average shipper MAUs in a given period are calculated by dividing (i) the sum of shipper MAUs for each month of a given period by (ii) the number of months in a given period. Shipper MAUs are defined as the number of active shippers on our platform in a given month. Active shippers are defined as the aggregate number of registered shipper accounts that have posted at least one shipping order on our platform during a given period. Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results Net Revenues (including value added taxes, or \"VAT,\" of RMB1,380.7 million and RMB1,222.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025, respectively). Total net revenues in the third quarter of 2025 were RMB3,358.2 million (US$471.7 million), representing an increase of 10.8% from RMB3,031.4 million in the same period of 2024, primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from freight matching services. Freight matching services. Revenues from freight matching services in the third quarter of 2025 were RMB2,797.6 million (US$393.0 million), representing an increase of 9.6% from RMB2,551.8 million in the same period of 2024. The increase was mainly due to the rapid increase in transaction service revenues. Freight brokerage service. Revenues from freight brokerage service in the third quarter of 2025 were RMB1,094.3 million (US$153.7 million), compared with RMB1,280.9 million in the same period of 2024, primarily attributable to a decrease in transaction volume, partially offset by an increase in service fee rate. Freight listing service. Revenues from freight listing service in the third quarter of 2025 were RMB247.1 million (US$34.7 million), an increase of 10.6% from RMB223.4 million in the same period of 2024, primarily due to the growing number of total paying members. Transaction service. Revenues from transaction service amounted to RMB1,456.1 million (US$204.5 million) in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 39.0% from RMB1,047.5 million in the same period of 2024, primarily driven by increases in order volume, penetration rate, and per-order transaction service fee. Value-added services.[4] Revenues from value-added services in the third quarter of 2025 were RMB560.7 million (US$78.8 million), an increase of 16.9% from RMB479.6 million in the same period of 2024. The increase was primarily due to growing demand for credit solutions. Cost of Revenues (including VAT net of government grants of RMB1,034.4 million and RMB1,033.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025, respectively). Cost of revenues in the third quarter of 2025 was RMB1,605.2 million (US$225.5 million), compared with RMB1,364.9 million in the same period of 2024, primarily due to increases in VAT, related tax surcharges and other tax costs, net of grants from government authorities. These tax-related costs net of government grants totaled RMB1,427.2 million, compared with RMB1,221.6 million in the same period of 2024, primarily due to an increase in tax costs net of government grants related to the Company's freight brokerage service. Sales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter of 2025 were RMB438.8 million (US$61.6 million), compared with RMB412.5 million in the same period of 2024. The increase was primarily due to further investments in enhancing user ecosystem construction and protecting user rights and interests. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2025 were RMB161.6 million (US$22.7 million), compared with RMB227.9 million in the same period of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower share-based compensation expenses. Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses in the third quarter of 2025 were RMB233.3 million (US$32.8 million), compared with RMB195.1 million in the same period of 2024. The increase was mainly due to the inclusion of Giga.AI's R&D costs, following the completion of the Company's further investment in Giga.AI on July 9, 2025 and its subsequent consolidation into the Company's financial results. Income from Operations. Income from operations in the third quarter of 2025 was RMB776.3 million (US$109.0 million), an increase of 1.9% from RMB762.0 million in the same period of 2024.

[5] Non-GAAP adjusted operating income is defined as income from operations excluding (i) share-based compensation expense; (ii) amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions; and (iii) compensation cost incurred in relation to acquisitions. See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" at the end of this press release. [6] ADS refers to American depositary shares, each of which represents 20 Class A ordinary shares. [7] Non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per ADS is net income attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding (i) share-based compensation expense; (ii) amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions; (iii) compensation cost incurred in relation to acquisitions; and (iv) tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments, divided by weighted average number of basic and diluted ADSs, respectively. For more information, refer to \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" at the end of this press release. [8] Non-performing loan ratio is calculated by dividing the outstanding principal and all accrued and unpaid interests of the on-balance sheet loans that were over 90 calendar days past due (excluding loans that are over 180 days past due and are therefore charged off) by the total outstanding principal and all accrued and unpaid interests of the on-balance sheet loans (excluding loans that are over 180 days past due and are therefore charged off) reduced by an allowance for estimated losses as of a specified date. Business Outlook The Company expects its total net revenues to be between RMB3.08 billion and RMB3.18 billion for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared with RMB3.17 billion in the same period of 2024. Excluding freight brokerage service, net revenues are expected to range from RMB2.18 billion to RMB2.28 billion, representing an estimated year-over-year growth rate of 17.1% to 22.5%. These forecasts are based on the Company's current and preliminary view of the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change and cannot be predicted with reasonable accuracy as of the date hereof.
