Commissioned by Lodgis Hospitality Holdings in partnership with VinaLiving, the project will introduce a new era of wellness-oriented design to The Grand Ho Tram Strip, one of the region's largest integrated resorts. Maia Ho Tram is a landmark hospitality and residential development on Vietnam\u2019s southern coast, designed by Dewan. Situated two hours from Ho Chi Minh City, Maia Ho Tram forms part of Zone A1 of Phase 3 of the resort's master plan. Dewan's design integrates a high-density hospitality and residential programme with a wellness-led ethos, capitalising on the site's oceanfront positioning while creating a strong sense of connection to its natural surroundings. A Vision for Wellness and Coastal Living Dewan's design narrative is centred on wellness and nature-driven principles. A cascading sequence of landscaped terraces and pools links the elevated podium to the beach, while a dramatic axial view connects the grand lobby to the sea. The development spans approximately 103,000 square metres, comprising two high-rise towers\u2014Peace and Happy\u2014a villa cluster, and a vibrant podium of shared amenities. The Peace Tower interiors are inspired by the \"golden forest\" concept, evoking the soft light filtering through trees at sunset. Villas arranged around a natural pond, podium-level leisure and dining options, and a rooftop wellness deck reinforce the development's focus on healthy, contemporary living. \"Maia Ho Tram is a milestone project that reflects the values we bring to every commission: sustainability, lifestyle-driven design, and architectural innovation,\" said Ammar Al Assam, CEO of Dewan Architects + Engineers. \"Vietnam and Southeast Asia are rapidly growing markets, and we are proud to contribute with a project that sets new benchmarks for wellness and hospitality, while creating long-term value for both residents and guests.\" Adding to this, Freek Jansen, Branch Manager of Dewan Southeast Asia, commented: \"Our vision for Maia Ho Tram is to design more than just buildings\u2014we are shaping an experience that brings people closer to nature while delivering the highest standards of contemporary living.
