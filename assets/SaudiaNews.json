Russian oil makes up more than a third of India\u2019s overall imports.Venezuelan oil is of the same quality as Russian oil \u2014 heavy, sour and perfect for making derivatives like fuel oil and diesel, which India\u2019s refineries are already set up to process, noted Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital.It\u2019s not clear, however, how long that transition may take. India buys more oil from Russia than Venezuela produces.\u201cFully replacing Russian oil with oil from Venezuela or the US will take significant investment,\u201d said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank Asset Management. \u201cBut. over time, this may create additional challenges for the Russian economy.\u201dIndia is a major purchaser of Russian oil, which has been sanctioned by most Western countries because of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war with Ukraine.Indian government officials have defended purchasing Russian oil previously, calling it essential to the country\u2019s energy security. India is the world\u2019s third-largest consumer of oil, and Russia is a close-by seller.And Russian oil has traded at a significant discount \u2013 roughly $16 a barrel \u2013 to OPEC or US crude, making it hard for India to quit, noted Robert Yawger at Mizuho Securities. Even after this agreement with the United States, Yawger said he expected India may flout sanctions and purchase Russian oil, as it has throughout the past several years.\u201cThere\u2019s been a zillion different ways they have been able to outflank sanction authorities,\u201d Yawger said. \u201cThey\u2019ll find a way to go dark fleet and get those barrels moved.\u201dBut as oil prices have come down over the past several months, the difference in price between sanctioned oil and non-sanctioned oil eroded, allowing India to make a change.\u201cWhen oil prices were high, that was big. But with oil prices coming down, that advantage is not so substantial,\u201d noted Arvind Subramanian, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former chief economic adviser for India\u2019s government. \u201cIf you throw into the calculus that Indian exporters were suffering from Trump tariffs, it became easier to stop buying Russian oil.\u201dTrump said Indian goods would immediately face an 18% tariff, down from a 50% \u2013 a rate that had included an additional 25% tariff Trump put in place in August to persuade India to stop purchasing Russian oil.A White House spokesperson told CNN that Trump will fully remove the additional tariff and reduce the so-called reciprocal tariff.Indian goods had among highest tariff rates imposed by the Trump administration. Because of various exemptions, the effective tariff rate on Indian goods was roughly 35%, according to Subramanian.Trump, calling Modi \u201cone of my greatest friends,\u201d also said India\u2019s prime minister agreed to reduce India\u2019s tariffs on US goods to zero, and to remove unspecified non-tariff barriers. Although Trump didn\u2019t explain which barriers would be removed, those often include special taxes on US companies\u2019 services or value-added taxes on goods.India also pledged to invest in American goods \u201cat a much higher level\u201d in addition to a $500 billion invesment in US energy, technology, agriculture and coal among other products, Trump said.Trump may have been eager to cut a deal with India after the European Union signed a long-sought free trade agreement with India last week, noted Subramanian.\u201cIf India gives preferential access to the EU, US business is affected,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been a domino effect.\u201dAlthough India isn\u2019t one of America\u2019s largest trading partners, the reduction in tariffs could nevertheless make a meaningful dent: The United States imported $95.5 billion in goods from India in 2025 as of November, 3% of the value of total imported goods, and it exported $42 billion of goods there over that time, according to the US Census Bureau. \u2014 Agencies", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["world"], "creator": ["\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u064a\u0629\u0650"], "language": "english", "country": ["saudi arabia"], "category": ["world"], "datatype": "news", "pubDate": "2026-02-03 06:00:42", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "fetched_at": "2026-02-03 06:24:54", "image_url": "https://saudigazette.com.sa/saudigazette/uploads/images/2026/02/03/2656774.webp", "video_url": null, "source_id": "saudigazette", "source_name": "Saudi Gazette", "source_priority": 356263, "source_url": "https://saudigazette.com.sa", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/saudigazette.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "b76417001482a1ead26372ee35d47146", "link": "https://news.google.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?oc=5", "title": "5 \u0645\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0646 \u0645\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0654\u0647\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0654\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0627\u0621 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0631\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0631\u064a -

Image1: The Nemophila Festivalhttps://cdn.kyodonewsprwire.jp/prwfile/release/M108967/202601273127/_prw_PI1fl_zf8dW150.jpg The Nemophila Festival has been held on Maishima, a manmade island adjacent to Yumeshima, another artificial island that served as the site of Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan. This major spring event allows visitors to enjoy blooming nemophila across an area of about 44,000 square meters overlooking the Akashi Kaikyo (Strait) Bridge, in the pleasant sea breeze. The festival is timed to coincide with the season when nemophila is in full bloom. The organizer recommends that visitors take photos of the breathtaking view of nemophila flowers blanketing the hillside in blue, harmonizing with the vast expanse of Osaka Bay and the clear blue sky. Approximately 230,000 people visited the Nemophila Festival 2024 that lasted for about a month. The nemophila, an annual plant native to North America, is called \"rurikarakusa\" in Japanese and produces beautiful flowers reminiscent of the blue sky. The vast blue expanse of nemophila in full bloom, as if they were connected to the sky and the sea, has become a hot topic on social media, particularly among younger generations, as being \"photogenic.\" There are many photo spots at the festival site, including a large \"MAISHIMA\" monument and an area showcasing seasonal flowers that bloom alongside nemophila. Moreover, the opening hours of the site will be extended until after sunset on weekends and public holidays as well as during the \"Golden Week\" holiday period from late April to early May. This will allow visitors to admire nemophila flowers that look fantastic as they reflect the glow of the sunset. Such a scene cannot be seen during the daytime. Maishima has been selected as one of Japan's Top 100 sunset spots (*). *The 100 sunset spots in Japan have been selected by \"NPO Association to Promote Landscapes with Sunset and Sunrise on the Japanese Archipelago.\"http://www.area-best.com/yuhi/yuhi100.htm Image2: Cherry blossoms collaboration zonehttps://cdn.kyodonewsprwire.jp/prwfile/release/M108967/202601273127/_prw_PI2fl_vFVxxIfF.jpg Image3: Nemophila flowers under the setting sunhttps://cdn.kyodonewsprwire.jp/prwfile/release/M108967/202601273127/_prw_PI3fl_6PtC4iT9.jpg *Images are for illustrative purposes only. - Kids' Park to be established at the site to allow families to enjoy together Kids' Park will be established where activities for children will be offered to enjoy the event with their parents and other relatives.

Feb. 3, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Creatine has long been a staple supplement for athletes and active individuals, but traditional formats such as powders, capsules, and tablets often come with trade-offs related to taste, preparation, and convenience. In response to these limitations, Natures Aid has introduced a gummy-based creatine supplement designed to combine verified formulation standards with a more accessible and enjoyable consumption experience. Natures Aid NSF-Certified Creatine Gummy Available in Multiple Flavors The Natures Aid NSF Certified Creatine Gummy represents a new approach to creatine delivery, built around the principle that effectiveness and ease of use should work together. Developed with a strong focus on formulation integrity and manufacturing quality, the product is positioned as the world's first Natures Aid creatine gummy created to achieve a carefully balanced combination of taste and potency. Formulation Approach and Production Technology Developing a creatine gummy presents unique formulation challenges, particularly when it comes to preserving ingredient stability while achieving a consistent texture. Natures Aid addresses this through its strategic partnership with SUCOTOND, a manufacturing specialist known for its proprietary \"zero-grain\" technology. The zero-grain technology supports uniform texture and content, contributing to a smooth, chewable consistency without the graininess sometimes associated with gummy supplements. This approach ensures that each gummy delivers consistent creatine content while maintaining a palatable mouthfeel. In addition to texture control, Natures Aid incorporates a cold-processing method during production. This technique is designed to help retain creatine integrity by minimizing exposure to high temperatures that may affect ingredient stability. Together, these processes form the scientific foundation of the creatine gummy, aligning manufacturing precision with consumer-friendly design. NSF Certification and Manufacturing Standards Quality assurance is a central element of the product's development. The gummies are NSF 173 certified, reflecting compliance with recognized standards related to ingredient verification, safety, and manufacturing practices. NSF certification is widely used within the supplement industry as an indicator of quality, particularly for products intended for active and performance-focused users. Natures Aid reports that the gummies are manufactured, tested, and bottled in a GMP-certified facility. This manufacturing environment is intended to support batch-to-batch consistency and quality control throughout the production process. Supporting Performance and Usage Format Natures Aid positions its creatine gummies as a convenient way to support muscle strength, muscle recovery, endurance, and daily energy needs. Rather than emphasizing short-term outcomes, the product is framed as a consistent supplement option designed to complement an active lifestyle over time. Each serving of Natures Aid creatine gummies delivers 5g=3 of pure creatine monohydrate, provided in 3 gummies per serving. Each bottle contains 135 gummies and is formulated to meet a wide range of dietary preferences. The gummies are designed for flexible daily use and can be taken at any time of day. This convenience allows users to integrate creatine supplementation into their routines at home, at work, or while traveling. Athletes and fitness enthusiasts may incorporate it into structured training and recovery routines, while busy professionals may appreciate its quick and portable format during demanding schedules. A New Direction in Creatine Delivery As the supplement market evolves, the delivery format has become an important factor alongside ingredient selection. Natures Aid's approach reflects a broader shift toward products that balance certification, manufacturing integrity, and everyday usability. By combining NSF certification, GMP-compliant manufacturing, and specialized production technologies, the brand introduces a new standard for gummy-based creatine supplements.
