Collaboration", "link": "https://en.prnasia.com/story/466686-0.shtml", "keywords": ["meq", "bio", "hea", "pha", "fda", "lic", "mtc"], "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "DONGGUAN, China, Oct. 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Fapon, a global leading life sciences company, is thrilled to announce its PSP CLIA reagent solution which demonstrates promising outcomes in extensive clinical validation studies targeting Chinese population. Leveraging its strategic partnership with Abionic SA and LASCCO SA, Fapon has gained exclusive rights to utilize the PSP biomarker for sepsis diagnosis in China. Recently, Abionic announced that its innovative sepsis early detection test, IVD CAPSULE PSP, has received 510(k) clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This approval marks a significant advancement in the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. Pancreatic Stone Protein (PSP) is an emerging sepsis biomarker used by clinicians as a screening tool for the early-detection of sepsis 24 - 48h earlier than current standards to support critical time-sensitive decisions. Produced by the pancreas and immune cells, PSP levels increase in response to infections and inflammation and has demonstrated significant sensitivity and specificity in detecting sepsis, particularly in critically ill patients. Clinical studies have shown that elevated PSP levels correlate closely with the progression of sepsis, allowing healthcare professionals to activate sepsis bundles earlier and improve outcomes. The FDA clearance highlights the marker and test's accuracy and reliability, supported by existing certifications from the EU CE, EU IVDR, and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). This sets the stage for PSP test's global implementation, emphasizing its potential impact on sepsis diagnostics. In October 2023, Fapon entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with Abionic SA and LASCCO SA. This alliance grants Fapon exclusive rights to utilize the PSP biomarker for sepsis diagnosis in China. Leveraging this collaboration and the test's recent FDA approval, Fapon is in the development and commercialization of PSP on its chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) analyzer within the territory. Beyond its focus in sepsis, Fapon is dedicated to advancing research in a range of critical areas, including infectious diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, anti-aging, AI-driven biomarkers and others. We continually strengthen our R&D capabilities through the establishment of global research centers, recruitment of industry-leading experts, and strategic licensing collaborations and investments in breakthrough technologies. Moving forward, Fapon is committed to providing more innovative, high-quality IVD products and services, and bringing earlier, more accurate, more convenient, and more accessible diagnostic solutions to our partners. About Fapon Fapon is a global leading life sciences company dedicated to providing integrated solutions and services for diagnostics, biopharma and biotherapy. Integrating a one-stop solution on raw materials, reagents and innovative open instrument platforms, the Company has grown into a leading supplier in in-vitro diagnostics.

This certification marks the first-ever Level 4 certification in Japan to operate up to 35 km/h on public roads shared by pedestrians and general traffic, specifically along the route between Shiojiri Station and Shiojiri City Hall. Developed by TIER IV, AI Pilot comprises the open-source software Autoware*3, sensors, a computer and an in-vehicle infotainment system, and it can be integrated into various vehicle models. The recent Shiojiri certification is part of TIER IV's ongoing support for the Japanese government's drive to promote the deployment of autonomous vehicles nationwide, and it follows Level 4 certification secured at GLP ALFALINK Sagamihara in October 2023. TIER IV also continues to develop a certification framework as a solution for partners developing autonomous driving systems, contributing significantly to the rollout of autonomous driving. \"In Japan, it is increasingly difficult to sustain regional public transportation amid population decline and an aging society,\" said TIER IV founder and CEO Shinpei Kato. \"At TIER IV, we are committed to addressing these challenges with autonomous driving technology. The Level 4 certification in Shiojiri represents a major step forward in these efforts. Looking ahead, we will continue to drive research, development and proof of concept (PoC) tests to accelerate the widespread rollout of autonomous solutions.\" \"Our city is striving to make the community safer and more convenient with next-generation transportation,\" said Takashi Momose, mayor of Shiojiri City. \"Since 2020, we have been partnering with TIER IV to explore autonomous driving services and conduct PoC tests. Last year, we began testing the TIER IV Minibus for Level 4 autonomous driving services. With the recent certification, we are nearing the implementation of Level 4 autonomous driving on public roads. Moving forward, we will continue working closely with TIER IV to promote Level 4 services. We hope this effort will spark a nationwide rollout, offering alternative transportation options that will help to reduce traffic accidents and revitalize local public transit.\" Residents of Shiojiri City have expressed great anticipation for the autonomous buses, with comments such as, \"I'm thrilled to see autonomous driving and digital transformation progressing in Shiojiri, and I can't wait to use the buses regularly,\" \"I hope efforts like this continue to create a more convenient transportation system,\" \"I fully support this initiative,\" and \"It's an honor for us as citizens to use an autonomous bus that represents such advanced technology and dedication.\" *1 In Japan, Level 4 is considered to be fully driverless autonomous driving, which means that a vehicle can handle most driving situations independently, under specific conditions, on public roads.*2 AI Pilot is a registered trademark of TIER IV.*3 Autoware is a registered trademark of the Autoware Foundation. About TIER IV TIER IV stands at the forefront of deep tech innovation, pioneering Autoware, the world's first open-source software for autonomous driving.
