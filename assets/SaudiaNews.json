The Spanish fragrance house's latest exclusive raw material brings opulence to fragrance compositions. Opulence in perfumery is about offering consumers fragrances that are rich in terms of their ingredients. Olivante\u00ae does so in a manner that is more caring and sustainable. Delivering opulence in fragrance creations As a world leader in the design of Middle Eastern fragrances, Eurofragance welcomes Olivante\u00ae as a new addition to its palette of ingredients that can deliver opulence in fragrance creations, a sought-after characteristic in perfumes of the Gulf region. Phenolic, animalic notes reminiscent of castoreum are often appreciated in mukhallat-type creations, and Olivante\u00ae possesses many of these olfactive properties. Olivante\u00ae is not only destined to a Middle Eastern target; but also can act as a highlighter of typical western world perfumery ingredients. Eurofragance Perfumers, who have been formulating with this innovative captive ingredient, state that with the inclusion of Olivante\u00ae, fruity notes become richer, gourmand notes more delightful and delectable, and certain white floral notes more intense. Because Olivante\u00ae is made from olive residual matter, following oil extraction, it does not have an oily smell. Bele\u0301n Garcia, Master Perfumer at Eurofragance who is composing with the raw material says: \"In recent years we have seen how consumers in the West have opened up to Middle Eastern perfumery. Powerful notes of leather and oud have gained consumer acceptance well beyond the Gulf Region. Olivante\u00ae is multi-faceted and offers some of these olfactive aspects that are now appreciated across geographies.\" Upcycling olive pulp into a perfumery ingredient In developing its fourth proprietary raw material, Eurofragance followed its sustainability philosophy. It collaborated with a partner in the olive oil industry who upcycles olive residues into various byproducts, following the extraction of oil from the olives. Felipe San Juan, R&D Manager Ingredients and Fragrance Performance and Magdalena Rey, Technical Perfumer, both at Eurofragance, spent months scouring the Spanish countryside searching for the variety of olive with the right concentration of the desired volatiles and precursors. Because different varieties of olives generate different odorant residues, this search was important to first identify the waste material with the most promising olfactive profile. They worked over a two-year period with a waste management engineer from a specific region of Spain to obtain the ideal original material. Eurofragance then transformed and refined it via an eco-friendly, multi-step purification process into a new perfumery ingredient that they named Olivante\u00ae. The result is a 100% natural, upcycled fragrance raw material. San Juan states: \"Olivante\u00ae cannot be made from any random olive pulp. Terroir and climate from a very specific region of Spain are key to this project. Then we applied our scientific expertise to characterize and separate the essential odorant molecules needed to develop a desirable captive ingredient.\" Olivante\u00ae is currently under patent review. An iconic Mediterranean ingredient The name Olivante\u00ae relates to the Levant, the birthplace of the olive tree, which was spread by Phoenicians westward across the Mediterranean to eventually reach Spain. Today, Eurofragance, the leading Spanish fragrance house, presents Olivante\u00ae a perfumery ingredient of Spanish heritage with global consumer appeal. Sine Guc\u0327etil, Global Marketing Director at Eurofragance says the following about Olivante\u00ae: \"Olivante\u00ae stands out for its ability to offer perfume richness, or opulence, in a manner that is fresher and less heavy. And, it's not just intended for fine fragrances. Our initial trials formulating personal care and home fragrancing products with Olivante\u00ae are promising and we feel that this is a proprietary ingredient with strong potential for broader market adoption.\" In addition to proposing a new olfactive experience, this natural ingredient is likely to appeal to marketers looking to offer their consumers products with a sustainability story.

At the Singapore Society of Oncology Annual Scientific Meeting 2025 (SSO ASM 2025), Gene Solutions showcased how Molecular Residual Disease (MRD) and AI-powered multi-omics technologies are advancing precision oncology across Asia-Pacific, reinforcing Singapore's role as a hub for innovation and global collaboration. The symposium, \"Advancing Precision Oncology: MRD and Multi-Omics in Solid Tumors,\" gathered leading oncologists and molecular biology experts to explore how ctDNA-MRD and multi-omics support clinicians and researchers in Singapore and across the Asia-Pacific. Key Scientific Highlights MRD assays analyze circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood to monitor cancer at the molecular level. Experts discussed how this approach may: Detect recurrence earlier \u2013 Identify molecular signals before imaging, enabling timely decisions Assess surgical outcomes \u2013 Determine residual cancer post-surgery, guiding follow-up strategies. Track treatment response \u2013 Monitor ctDNA clearance to review treatment strategies in real time. Support risk stratification\u2013 Identify high-risk patients for tailored treatment, potentially reducing unnecessary toxicity for low-risk patients. Panel discussion: Ida Deleskog Lindstroem, Global Medical Affairs Director, Gene Solutions (first from left), Dr. Christopher Wong, Chief Operations Officer/Laboratory Director, Gene Solutions (second from left), Dr. Lee Chern Siang, Raffles Cancer Centre (second from right), and Assistant Professor Dr. Tan Chia-Ken Aaron, NCCS (first from right), discussing multi-omics and ctDNA-MRD advancements. Gene Solutions' Scientific Approach Unlike single-modality tests, Gene Solutions' platform integrates DNA, RNA, and AI-enhanced multi-omics signals for comprehensive tumor profiling and personalized ctDNA monitoring. This multi-omics approach has the potential to improve ctDNA sensitivity, detect complex gene fusions, and predict primary tumor locations \u2014 supporting deeper insights for more informed, personalized treatment decisions. Recent studies published in JCO Oncology Advances1 and Nature's npj Breast Cancer2 highlight the potential of ctDNA-based MRD testing to predict early recurrence and contribute to affordable monitoring strategies in real-world contexts. Through its CAP-accredited Singapore laboratory and global operations network, Gene Solutions fosters scientific collaboration to advance genomic research and precision oncology across the Asia-Pacific.
