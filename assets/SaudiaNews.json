The company's flagship solution, MarinaNet, automatically extracts operational data from ships' Noon Reports \u2014 regardless of format \u2014 and converts them into fully auditable regulatory reports, reducing the traditional manual workload by up to 80%. Following rapid domestic traction, including onboarding more than 30 major South Korean shipping companies within six months of launch, MarinaChain is now accelerating its global push. Singapore has been selected as the company's first strategic international base. Singapore: The Crossroads of Global Maritime Decarbonisation \"Singapore is where the future of maritime decarbonisation is being shaped,\" said Sung Yeop Ha, Co-Founder and Director of MarinaChain, who leads the company's global business and partnerships. \"With shipping lines, fuel suppliers, financial institutions, and regulators operating in one ecosystem, Singapore is uniquely positioned to become the world's most important hub for zero-carbon maritime operations.\" The joint venture is being formed with GreenMarine, a Singapore-based cleantech provider specialising in green methanol trading, sustainability consulting, and regulatory training.
