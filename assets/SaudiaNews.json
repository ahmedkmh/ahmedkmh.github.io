The year-over-year increase was attributable to the increase in new product delivery volume, partially offset by the lower average selling price due to changes in product mix and pricing strategy between the two quarters. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly attributable to the significant increase in deliveries of Zeekr 7X in the fourth quarter of 2024. Revenues from sales of batteries and other components were RMB1,930.8 million (US$264.5 million) for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a decrease of 52.2% from RMB4,038.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 40.5% from RMB3,245.3 million for the third quarter of 2024.

The year-over-year decrease was mainly due to the significant growth in sales of R&D service to our related parts in the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by the increased sales of vehicle spare parts in the fourth quarter of 2024. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly attributable to the acceptance of a cluster of R&D projects at the end of the year. Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin Cost of revenues was RMB18,461.4 million (US$2,529.2 million) for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 31.6% from RMB14,029.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and an increase of 19.8% from RMB15,416.2 million for the third quarter of 2024. The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to the increase in vehicle deliveries, partially offset by the lower average cost of sales due to changes in product mix between the two quarters. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly attributable to the increase in vehicle delivery volume, partially offset by procurement savings as the cost of auto parts and materials decreased. Gross profit was RMB4,316.5 million (US$591.4 million) for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 85.4% from RMB2,328.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and an increase of 46.7% from RMB2,941.8 million for the third quarter of 2024.

The slight year-over-year increase was in line with our investment strategy in research and development, which was partially offset by lower vehicle technology usage fees. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to the incremental design and development costs for new products and technologies. Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB2,816.5 million (US$385.9 million) for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 27.6% from RMB2,207.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and an increase of 23.8% from RMB2,274.8 million for the third quarter of 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share attributed to ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per ADS attributed to ordinary shareholders, in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. By excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business and enhance the overall understanding of the Company's past performance and future prospects. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company's management in its financial and operational decision-making. The non-GAAP financial measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing the Company's operating performance, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss or other consolidated statements of comprehensive loss data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP Results\" set forth in this announcement.
