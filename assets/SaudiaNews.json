The Global Times reporters observed on Sunday that the streets of Hanoi were adorned with the national flags of China and Vietnam to welcome Xi's arrival. Vietnamese from various sectors expressed to the Global Times their warm welcome for the Chinese leader's visit, anticipating that the \"comrades plus brothers\" friendship between China and Vietnam will open a new chapter. While riding the China-constructed Cat Linh-Ha Dong elevated railway in Hanoi - the first metro line in Vietnam - on Sunday, Global Times reporters ran into 73-year-old Ade (pseudonym) and his wife, who were chatting with friends and heading downtown for a fun outing. Ade told reporters that he heard about the Chinese leader's visit to Vietnam on the news, and that he was glad to see China-Vietnam relations getting stronger. \"We hope more collaborative projects like the metro can take place between the two sides, which have made our daily lives convenient. My wife and I seldom went to downtown Hanoi before the metro was set up, but now we can enjoy the ride every now and then,\" he said. Global Times reporters also visited Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK or Chinese Proficiency Test) site at the Confucius Institute of Hanoi University on Saturday. By 7 am, candidates have already gathered in the garden outside, sitting on benches or along the curb, reviewing their notes as they waited to register. Around 8 am, examinees began entering the venue - many appeared in their 20s and accompanied by their parents. \"I want to study in China because we're neighbors, and our social and economic ties are growing closer.\" \"If you can speak Chinese, it's easier to get a job,\" students taking the HSK told the Global Times, as they shared that the HSK is now seen as one of the most valuable and sought-after exams among Vietnamese youth. Qin Yonghua, Chinese Director of the Confucius Institute jointly established by Guangxi Normal University and Hanoi University, told the Global Times that \"There is data showing that 81 percent of Vietnamese youth with study experience in China develop a more positive perception of the country, far higher than among those with no direct exposure.\" \"Language has never been just a communication tool. Vietnam's 'Chinese language fever' is helping to build trust at the people-to-people level and strengthen the foundation of China-Vietnam friendship, allowing our traditional ties to flourish,\" Qin said. Significant friendship This marks Xi's fourth state visit to Vietnam as general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and Chinese president. The trip coincides with the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and Vietnam, two socialist neighbors that have forged an enduring bond as \"comrades and brothers,\" according to Xinhua News Agency. On the eve of the visit, Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam He Wei told the Global Times in an exclusive interview that this year carries special significance for bilateral relations, as it marks the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Vietnam, as well as the Year of People-to-People Exchanges. He emphasized that the 75-year journey has repeatedly proven that only when China-Vietnam relations develop well can each country's development remain steady, bilateral exchanges and cooperation advance solidly, and the peoples of both nations benefit more from the relationship. The ambassador also stressed that in today's complex and volatile international landscape, China and Vietnam, both socialist countries, are like-minded comrades and good partners whose future is closely interconnected. In the face of an increasingly turbulent world, China and Vietnam should be defenders of regional peace and stability, promoters of regional cooperation, and upholders of international economic rules and fairness and justice. Xi paid a state visit to Vietnam in 2023, and now Vietnam marked his first destination of his first state visit this year, which means China attaches great significance to the country, Gu Xiaosong, dean of the ASEAN Research Institute of Hainan Tropical Ocean University, told the Global Times on Sunday. The naval ship formations of China and Vietnam will conduct the 38th joint patrol in the Beibu Gulf waters on April 16-17, according to the relevant agreements and arrangements between the two militaries, China's Ministry of National Defense announced Sunday. This will further enhance practical cooperation between the two militaries and improve their capability to safeguard the security of the relevant sea areas. Gu said that as a country that shares both land and sea borders with China, and both being socialist countries led by communist parties with similar political systems and development paths, it is important for China and Vietnam to join hands to cope with turbulent international geopolitics and tariff turmoil. During a special video conference on Thursday, the ASEAN cautioned that \"The unprecedented imposition of tariffs will disrupt regional and global trade and investment flows, as well as supply chains, affecting businesses and consumers worldwide.\" Amid significant uncertainties brought by trade frictions, Gu said it is important to strengthen win-win cooperation between China and Southeast Asia, including Vietnam. This collaboration should focus on increasing trade and exploring opportunities in high-potential areas such as the green economy and supply chain management. Gu noted that enhanced cooperation can provide both China and its Southeast Asian partners with a competitive advantage in navigating external challenges. By fostering greater mutual benefits, these nations can better position themselves to respond to the shifting dynamics of the global landscape. Neighborhood diplomacy President Xi will also pay state visits to Malaysia and Cambodia from April 15 to 18, at the invitation of King of Malaysia Sultan Ibrahim and King Norodom Sihamoni of Cambodia, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said. Xi on Sunday exchanged congratulations with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto over the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries. Xi's visit to those Southeast Asian countries came also after he called for building a community with a shared future with neighboring countries and striving to open new ground for China's neighborhood work at a central conference on work related to neighboring countries, which was held in Beijing from April 8 to 9. Currently, the world is experiencing fundamental changes unseen in a century, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times, noting that against such a backdrop, strengthening relations with those Southeast Asian countries can help enhance the stability and resilience of China's overall foreign strategy. Neighboring countries' peace and stability serve as the foundation for China's global diplomacy and a stable neighborhood helps China better address external challenges. On the other, in an unstable international environment, neighboring countries are seeking to deepen cooperation with China and use such cooperation to enhance their own ability to withstand risks, said Yang, noting that the trend of the two sides \"marching forward hand in hand\" is becoming increasingly evident.

"description": "BEIJING, April 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- A report from People's Daily: On a recent spring morning at Youyiguan Port, known as Friendship Pass, on the China-Vietnam border in Pingxiang city, south China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, a steady stream of trucks lined up at the border crossing, ferrying tropical fruits into China and hauling machinery and electronics to Vietnam. The scene is brisk, efficient - and increasingly automated. Photo shows Youyiguan Port, known as Friendship Pass in Pingxiang city, south China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. (Photo by Zhao Weidong) Friendship Pass, one of the largest and most efficient land border crossings between China and Vietnam, is undergoing a high-tech overhaul. The site is being transformed into China's first cross-border smart port, with the Chinese section scheduled to commence pilot operations later this year. Roughly 1,500 vehicles now pass through the port each day. Once the upgrade is completed on both sides, clearance capacity is expected to multiply, strengthening trade links between China and ASEAN and deepening regional economic integration. For Vietnamese truck driver Nguyen, the changes are already evident. \"I just roll down my window for fingerprint and facial scans - the process typically takes about 45 seconds,\" he said. Nguyen regularly transports fruits from Vietnam to distribution centers in China. The streamlined clearance process now enable him to make up to 30 round trips per month. \"I hope to see even more Vietnamese fruits exported to China,\" he said. \"Faster clearance means more deliveries - and higher earnings.\" At a bonded warehouse near Friendship Pass, run by the Guangxi branch of Fuliankang Cross-Border Logistics, shipments of high-value electronic components arrive from Chinese factories, bound for assembly lines in Vietnam. With a few taps on his phone, warehouse manager Li Zhen pulls up real-time customs data. \"The Smart Youyiguan app allows us to submit declarations in advance and track clearance in real time,\" he said. \"It has drastically reduced processing times.\" In 2024, the company's exports via Friendship Pass surged to $240 million more than doubling the previous year's total. The gains reflect a broader digital transformation underway at the port. Since 2022, Youyiguan Customs has rolled out a range of digital systems - including a smart logistics management platform, an intelligent inspection assistance system, and a smart quarantine processing system - all aimed at reducing delays and improving throughput. In the first two months of this year, trade at the port recorded double-digit growth, giving China's foreign trade a strong start. The smart logistics management platform allows for real-time tracking from the moment a cargo manifest is submitted, using BeiDou satellite positioning and video surveillance to streamline dispatching. Meanwhile, the intelligent inspection assistance system uses display screens and geomagnetic sensors to monitor traffic flow and assign inspection bays automatically - cutting wait times by 20 percent and increasing turnover efficiency by 35 percent. The quarantine process has also been fully digitized. From vehicle queuing and fumigation scheduling to gas concentration monitoring and report submission, the smart quarantine processing system now saves an average of 3.5 hours per shipment. \"Import clearance for a fruit container previously took six hours,\" said Lu Qiujing, a business manager at a Guangxi-based fruit importer. \"Now it can be done in as little as three. That means less spoilage and quicker delivery to market.\" The China-Vietnam cross-border smart port project at Friendship Pass represents a major investment in regional trade infrastructure, with a total outlay of 1.062 billion yuan ($145.49 million). It integrates advanced technologies such as satellite navigation, 5G technology, AI-driven transport vehicles, and large-scale automated cargo-handling machinery, along with smart inspection systems and a centralized command platform - all engineered to sustain uninterrupted, 24/7 operations. The Chinese segment of the project has been largely complete and is now in system integration and testing phases, with trial runs scheduled to begin within the year. \"Once completed, the port will enable 24/7 customs clearance,\" said Shi Lei, deputy director of Youyiguan Customs. \"Goods will be able to travel from Nanning in Guangxi to Bac Giang or Bac Ninh in Vietnam within 24 hours - making round-the-clock cross-border trade a reality.\" Vietnamese authorities, for their part, approved their smart port development plan on August 17, 2024. Construction on the Vietnamese side is now in full swing. Wei Zhaohui, director of the Guangxi International Expo Affairs Bureau, called the project not only a major step forward in enhancing port clearance capacity and expanding trade between the two countries, but also a model for promoting trade and investment liberalization across the broader China-ASEAN region.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-04-14 03:20:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://mma.prnasia.com/media2/2663484/1.jpg?p=medium600", "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 1333464, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/en_prnasisa.png", "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top"], "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "3dbef2a0c76535caab098bd7aab0bc05", "title": "DEKRA continues on a path of growth and transformation", "link": "https://en.prnasia.com/story/485179-0.shtml", "keywords": ["aut", "ern", "fin", "trn"], "creator": null, "description": "Future-oriented business model ensures successful fiscal year 2024 Revenue and EBIT increased again in 2024, despite a volatile environment Number of core employees grew further DEKRA is very well positioned in its 100th anniversary year as it successfully transforms from a traditional vehicle inspection provider into a leading independent expert for digital and software-defined mobility STUTTGART, Germany, April 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- DEKRA remained on track in 2024, again growing its business in a volatile economic and geopolitical environment.
