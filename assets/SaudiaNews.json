ICW & BuildXpo 2025 - Constructing The Future of ASEAN Event Summary Video Jointly organised by the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) Malaysia and Qube Integrated Malaysia Sdn Bhd, this year's event was themed \"Constructing the Future of ASEAN\", in line with its position of being the premier construction industry event during Malaysia's ASEAN chairmanship this year. Gamuda Berhad returned as a key industry partner of the event, reinforcing ICW & BuildXpo's position as an impactful platform for knowledge exchange, networking, and business opportunities across the construction ecosystem. Strong Business Outcomes and Global Collaboration The event attracted a total of 15,987 industry professionals and trade visitors over three days, with BuildXpo 2025 achieving RM1.41 billion in potential sales through a combination of business matchmaking sessions, hosted buyer programmes, and on-site transactions. These remarkable results reflect Malaysia's growing appeal as a key trade and investment hub for the construction and built environment sector, reaffirming its status as the premier construction platform in Malaysia and Southeast Asia. The phenomenal business generated was driven largely by strategic partnerships and high-value exhibition sales: Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) and high-level potential deals contributed over RM1.05 billion Exhibition transactions and projected sales contributed an additional RM322 million The International Sourcing Programme co-organised with MATRADE and Hosted Buyer Programme curated by Qube generated RM30.8 million The event also recorded increased international participation, with exhibitors and buyers from Malaysia, Austria, Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, Mainland China, Greece, Hong Kong SAR, India, Kuwait, Myanmar, Philippines, Qatar, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Taipei, Thailand, Trinidad & Tobago, United Kingdom, and United States of America. Among the key highlights of BuildXpo 2025 was the strong participation from the Cambodia Pavilion, which represented the country's expanding role in regional infrastructure and investment. Cambodia Pavilion Head of Delegation to BuildXpo 2025, Mr. Ly Salim, Managing Director of D.C.O.N Development & Import Export Co., Ltd, said: \"The Cambodia Pavilion's participation at BuildXpo Malaysia 2025 has been a tremendous milestone for Cambodia's growing presence in the regional construction, infrastructure, and innovation landscape. Through the Pavilion, Cambodian enterprises successfully signed six MoUs with major international companies from Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea, with a combined potential value exceeding USD300 million across sectors such as civil infrastructure, renewable energy, logistics, clean water systems, and digital financial technology.\" \"Collectively, these partnerships highlight Cambodia's readiness to embrace innovation, technology transfer, and international cooperation. The Cambodia Pavilion's success at BuildXpo Malaysia 2025 reflects the country's growing confidence, professionalism, and potential to become a dynamic hub for sustainable investment and development in the ASEAN region. We look forward to seeing these collaborations translate into tangible outcomes that uplift communities and strengthen Cambodia's economic future,\" Mr. Ly Salim added. A Milestone Year for ICW The success of ICW & BuildXpo 2025 caps off a remarkable year for the platform, which also saw the inaugural ICW Borneo take place in May 2025 in Kuching, Sarawak. The Borneo edition marked the first time ICW expanded beyond Peninsular Malaysia, drawing strong participation from East Malaysian stakeholders and reinforcing CIDB's efforts to promote sustainable and inclusive industry growth nationwide. Both editions underscored ICW & BuildXpo's position as the region's most comprehensive construction industry platform that connects businesses, showcase innovations, and champion sustainability-driven development. CIDB Malaysia Chief Executive, Madam Zainora Zainal, said: \"The success of ICW & BuildXpo 2025, alongside the inaugural ICW Borneo held earlier this year, reflects the construction industry's growing resilience and adaptability in embracing sustainability, technology, and innovation.\" \"This year's strong business outcomes and global participation reaffirm Malaysia's role as a leading hub for regional collaboration in the built environment. CIDB will continue to drive initiatives that accelerate digital transformation, strengthen industry standards, and support sustainable growth in line with the national development agenda,\" she added. Qube Integrated Malaysia Executive Chairman, Mr. Richard Teo, said: \"We are proud to have witnessed another remarkable year for ICW and BuildXpo, which together have generated over RM1.4 billion in potential sales and fostered countless opportunities for partnerships across borders.\" \"The growing international participation, particularly through country pavilions and trade delegations, demonstrates how Malaysia continues to serve as a dynamic platform for connecting global players with the region's fast-evolving construction ecosystem. We look forward to building on this momentum as we continue to expand and innovate future editions of the event,\" he added. The 2026 edition of this event, scheduled to take place from 10 to 12 November 2026 at MITEC, promises to be even bigger with the introduction of a new concurrent exhibition. The GlassTech Asia & Fenestration Asia (GAFA) 2026, organised by Messe Munchen International (MMI) Asia Pte Ltd, is an exciting showcase that will be held in conjunction with BuildXpo 2026, to further elevate Malaysia's profile in the global built environment.

A key national strategy has been to develop the Chengdu-Chongqing region into an influential sci-tech innovation hub. The Western (Chengdu) Science City has emerged as a cornerstone of this transformation, establishing a high-level innovation ecosystem comprising one national laboratory, four national innovation centers, 10 major science infrastructures, and four Tianfu laboratories. Some 96 national innovation platforms \u2014 including the National Precision Medicine Industrial Innovation Center and National Supercomputing Center \u2014 have set up operations, alongside 27 national-level research institutions and 65 collaborative innovation projects launched with universities and research institutes. Chengdu moved early to cultivate future industries, releasing implementation guidelines for 24 sectors including humanoid robotics and flexible display technology. The city further accelerated this push in July this year with a 100 billion yuan ($14.1 billion) future industry fund targeting hard-tech startups. Online and offline service systems represented by \"Sci-Tech Express plus Sci-Tech Island\" have streamlined the commercialization of innovations. The offline Sci-Tech Island hosts 102 service providers offering 104 types of services, while the online Sci-Tech Express platform has served sci-tech enterprises more than 200,000 times. From the Chengdu 2021 World University Games, where over 170 tech products enhanced venues and viewing experiences, to AI-powered rehabilitation robots now serving elderly residents, innovation has become tangible across urban life. The city has also deployed an intelligent safety monitoring network covering underground pipelines, bridges and tunnels. Chengdu's innovation landscape now includes more than 14,500 national high-tech enterprises and 354 national-level \"little giant\" firms, or elite SMEs that specialize in niche sectors, according to the Chengdu Science and Technology Bureau. The city has established five national innovation and entrepreneurship demonstration bases, 76 national incubators and maker spaces, as well as another 76 provincial and municipal incubators hosting 5,702 in-progress projects. Talent initiatives have helped secure the \"China's Best Talent-Attracting City\" title for six consecutive years. Policy breakthroughs in intellectual property rights have spurred 36 local universities and research institutes to complete over 2,000 achievement ownership verifications, incubating 588 enterprises with nearly 21 billion yuan in social investment.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["cpr", "stm"], "creator": null, "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["technology", "top"], "datatype": "news", "pubDate": "2025-11-28 03:12:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://mma.prnasia.com/media2/2833982/image_5000783_6608596.jpg?p=medium600", "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 4111305, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/en_prnasisa.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": false}], "nextPage": "1764299520897769592"}
