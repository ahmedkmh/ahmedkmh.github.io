FF Par - FF's Co-Creation User Ecosystem Partner program: FF Par introduces two major upgrades to the traditional dealership model. First, a business model upgrade. Instead of relying solely on one-time vehicle sales, FF Par enables a sustainable revenue model built on vehicle sales + user operations + intelligent terminal ecosystem operations. Partners can share in the long-term value across the product lifecycle\u2014without bearing traditional risks such as high inventory pressure, high operating costs, or pricing instability. Second, a capital model upgrade. Partners are brought into FF's co-creation ecosystem\u2014 meaning dealers don't just sell products, they become stakeholders, directly participating in and sharing the long-term capital value. Upgraded dealer & partner platform \u2013 FF Par redefines the traditional dealership model with a user-operations\u2013driven partner platform that upgrades both business (vehicle sales + user operations + intelligent terminal ecosystem) and capital models (partners becoming FF-level value sharers), and positions future dealers as \"intelligent terminal operators\" selling both vehicles and robots. FF firmly believes that FF's user co-creation ecosystem will inject new vitality into automotive dealerships across the United States\u2014offering an innovative solution built on user operations and intelligent terminal ecosystems. FF also believes that the future sales channels for robotics will highly overlap with automotive channels. Tomorrow's car dealers can evolve into \"intelligent terminal operators\"\u2014selling both vehicles and robotics products. Looking over the long-term, FF believes that global robot ownership could reach tens of billions of units over time, potentially far exceeding the scale of today's global automobile fleet.
