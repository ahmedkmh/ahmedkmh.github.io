first ever encounter of its ambassadors Kylian Mbappe\u0301 and Usain Bolt at the Geneva Arena, as part of the Watches & Wonders fair. This unforgettable celebration was a tribute to Hublot's trailblazing spirit and an ode to the brand's \"Art of Fusion\". Hublot: Eneko Atxa, Clare Smyth, Anne-Sophie Pic, Andreas Caminada and Yannick Alleno Last night, Hublot brought together the international elite of watchmaking, sport, gastronomy and music to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Big Bang, the watch that revolutionised contemporary Swiss watchmaking. The event highlighted the many facets of the world of Hublot, truly sensorial experiences. Chefs and brand ambassadors Anne-Sophie Pic, Clare Smyth, Yannick Alle\u0301no, Eneko Atxa and Andreas Caminada boast a combined total of 43 Michelin stars between them; these five culinary masters put on an unprecedented gastronomic performance as they prepared personalised signature dishes created especially for the anniversary. Each chef worked live in their own space, creating culinary delights which were a treat for the guests' eyes and taste buds. Julien Tornare, CEO of Hublot, welcomed the guests with a moving speech recounting the Big Bang's two decades of phenomenal success. \"Our icon, the Big Bang, has redefined the codes of contemporary watchmaking,\" he said. \"Twenty years on, celebrating its revolutionary mindset, the Big Bang continues to embody the boldness, innovation and pioneering spirit for which Hublot is renowned. It was such an emotional moment to have our Hublot Family united on this unprecedented occasion\". The evening continued with a breathtaking performance by master mentalist and friend of the brand, Lior Suchard, who stunned the audience. Among the guests present were a host of Hublot ambassadors and friends, including football champion Kylian Mbappe\u0301, the world's fastest man, Usain Bolt, professional sailor and 3 times Vende\u0301e Globe finisher, Alan Roura, world champion sprinter, Mujinga Kambundji, and head coaches for the France and Portugal football teams Didier Deschamps and Roberto Martinez. The Geneva-born, New York-based DJ, producer and multi-instrumentalist Alissia then ignited the room with a vibrant set. Her unique style, a blend of funk, R&B and pop, set the stage perfectly for the highlight of the event: A performance by Mika. Hublot invited the Lebanese-American-British artist famous for his numerous hits to celebrate this special anniversary, and the star duly delivered a dazzling performance in an electric atmosphere. The party went on until the early hours of the morning, with Alissia returning to the decks for a high-energy DJ set that had guests dancing the night away. A true creative canvas, the Big Bang has set the stage for two decades of breathtaking ingenuity, enabling the introduction of new materials, rethinking traditional mechanical complications and transcending the barriers between watchmaking and art.

(\"Colonial\") to Colossus AcquireCo LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. and its institutional partners (collectively, \"Brookfield\"), for $1.45 billion. \"This divestment reflects our focus on performance, discipline and simplification,\" said Andrew Smith, President of Shell Trading & Supply. \"It will allow us to concentrate on areas where we have scale and competitive advantage.\" The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in Q4 2025. Notes to editors Together with Shell, the co-owners of Colonial Enterprises, Inc. have agreed to sell 100% of their Colonial shares to Brookfield. Colonial is divided among five partners: Shell Midstream Operating LLC (16.125%), Koch Capital Investments Company, LLC (28.088%); KKR-Keats Pipeline Investors, L.P. (23.443%); Caisse de de\u0301po\u0302t et placement du Que\u0301bec (16.549%); and IFM Investors (IFM) (15.795%). The sale values Shell's share of Colonial at $1.45 billion, inclusive of approximately $500 million in non-recourse debt and excluding customary closing adjustments. Colonial operates as an independent company and fully owns Colonial Pipeline Company (CPC), a non-operated venture, as well as Colonial Marketing Company. CPC provides oil products transportation services from the US Gulf Coast to the US Atlantic Seaboard. Shell Midstream Operating LLC is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Shell Pipeline Company LP, and the largest pipeline operator in the Gulf of America. It transports 1.5 billion barrels of crude oil, refined products, chemicals and NGLs annually through its vast network of pipelines and tank farms across 12 states and the Gulf of America. The U.S. is a key market for Shell, where it has interests in 50 states and employs more than 12,000 people who work to provide a secure supply of energy today, while tackling the energy challenges of the future. Shell's U.S. portfolio of operated companies and interests consists of oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, lubricants and refined fuel products along with renewables such as wind, solar, and mobility segments like electric vehicle charging. Cautionary note The companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this press release \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and \"Group\" are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ''Subsidiaries'', \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this press release refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The term \"joint venture\", \"joint operations\", \"joint arrangements\", and \"associates\" may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest. Forward-looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\"; \"ambition\"; ''anticipate''; ''believe''; \"commit\"; \"commitment\"; ''could''; ''estimate''; ''expect''; ''goals''; ''intend''; ''may''; \"milestones\"; ''objectives''; ''outlook''; ''plan''; ''probably''; ''project''; ''risks''; \"schedule\"; ''seek''; ''should''; ''target''; ''will''; \"would\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this press release, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2024 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this press release and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this press release, April 4, 2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Shell's Net Carbon Intensity Also, in this press release we may refer to Shell's \"Net Carbon Intensity\" (NCI), which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell's NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell's \"Net Carbon Intensity\" or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries. Shell's net-zero emissions target Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures This press release may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements. The contents of websites referred to in this press release do not form part of this press release. We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this press release that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website www.sec.gov.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-04-04
