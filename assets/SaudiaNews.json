International Green Energy Expo, the nation's premier renewable energy event held at Daegu EXCO Convention Center. The showcase at Booth L-260 featured TCL Solar's industry-leading Shingled, TOPCon and BC module technologies, drawing exceptional interest from attendees throughout the three-day exhibition. This exhibition marks TCL Solar's first appearance in Korea after completing its brand upgrade. As a strategic extension of TCL in renewable energy sector, TCL Solar deeply integrates the advantages of TCL Group, TCL Zhonghuan and SunPower. Relying on TCL's global layout advantages, TCL Zhonghuan's leading advantages in the vertical field of silicon wafers and SunPower's revolutionary patented technology advantages in the research and development of multiple modules. As the world's 8th largest energy consumer and 7th biggest carbon emitter, Korea faces significant energy security and climate challenges. With 93.8% energy dependence on imports and only 8.2% renewable energy in its total energy mix, the country is actively transforming its energy landscape. Under the government's \"Carbon Neutrality by 2050\" strategy, Korea plans to increase renewable energy generation to 30% by 2030, creating substantial market opportunities for global green energy leaders like TCL Solar. TCL Solar showcased its full product lineup, including BC, TOPCon half-cut, and shingled modules during this big event, offering customers a wide range of choices for different scenarios. TCL Solar's BC technology is built upon the legacy of SunPower. And it was fully acquired by TCL Zhonghuan in 2025. Its' BC modules perfectly address Korea's market characteristics with three core advantages: high efficiency, superior reliability, and premium aesthetics - particularly suitable for Korea's limited land/roof resources, high architectural standards, and diverse environmental conditions. The exhibited G11RA-72P BC module demonstrates significant power generation improvement over mainstream TOPCon products through optimized performance in partial shading, temperature coefficient, operating temperature, and power linear attenuation. While Korea remains one of the few GW-level PV markets globally, its high entry barriers and lengthy certification processes pose challenges. TCL Solar completed thorough preparatory work, with multiple shingled and half-cut module types already obtaining KS (Korean Industrial Standards) certification, establishing solid reputation and customer foundation in this steadily growing market. TCL Solar Shingled module adopts large-sized silicon wafer in various specifications, efficient TOPCon cell technology and high-density packing technology. Combined with a series of innovative technology such as 1/3 cut cell design and series parallel circuit design with independent intellectual property rights, it significantly improves product performance and reliability. Moreover, Shingled module pays attention to aesthetic feature, with consistent appearance and strong identification, making it perfectly integrated with various application scenarios. During the exhibition, TCL Solar successfully signed module supply agreements with two renowned local companies in South Korea, Dabin E&C and Korea Green Power Co., Ltd. Both companies have long been deeply rooted in Korea market and have accumulated extensive experience in photovoltaic project development and operation. \"We are very pleased to have this collaboration with TCL Solar. The performance and high efficiency of TCL Solar's modules align perfectly with our requirements. We look forward to working hand in hand with TCL Solar to drive the development and transition of renewable energy in Korea.\" Said representative from Korea Green Power Co., Ltd. Moving forward, TCL Solar will continue to uphold its customer-centric philosophy, maintain a long-term commitment to technological research and development, and increase R&D investment. TCL Solar is dedicated to providing high-quality products and services for Korean photovoltaic market, promoting regional sustainable development, and fully supporting the achievement of Korea's 2030 renewable energy goals.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-04-25 03:18:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 1333464, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/en_prnasisa.png", "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top"], "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "675a9e21aee17751e8c089115ea63399", "title": "\u0647\u0648\u0646\u0631 GT Pro \u064a\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0649 \u0633\u0627\u0645\u0633\u0648\u0646\u062c Galaxy S25 Ultra.. \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0641\u0633\u0629 \u0634\u0631\u0633\u0629 \u062a\u062a\u062e\u0637\u0649 \u062d\u062f\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0631 - ajil.news", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAJBVV95cUxPNk1WcDlCU2RlNnFSMjFrR1FVV25jdmpRMjBudHZxbTFzOTBVeVp0bllBUHlNUEVGbFY1SUUwVDNLWDIwLVdENE96MFVkN19tSmxZYXBORnE4c3BJbC1MTDFDYlVKN2oxX1V4Y3ZkMTJ2UTB1Zmg3c0lURk50WTFWUlNsWkRzMGVLeE9NcUtSaXUzWXpFNDlKN0ctaEtVdUlpaHBXTmU2ZUF1LWRzLUNLLURuSF9LTGNBUFM1dGF1ZzJURm9SRzgxTTVhMnRnMGlXS0U3bjBRcEZ3SGEtMTRDLUloNVFKVHZndFRZZlBfdDZJaGlubXQtYVNSaURHRkltT3NhZ242VjhGWFZKYnJ0ZGtHdC12ZUNZR05mVnZVMUMxYmNRYzNvQzZHazNCMHEwd2k0YkM1ZnVabDRH?oc=5", "keywords": null, "creator": null, "description": "\u0647\u0648\u0646\u0631 GT Pro \u064a\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0649 \u0633\u0627\u0645\u0633\u0648\u0646\u062c Galaxy S25 Ultra.. \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0641\u0633\u0629 \u0634\u0631\u0633\u0629 \u062a\u062a\u062e\u0637\u0649 \u062d\u062f\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0631 ajil.news\u0639\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u063a\u0637\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u062e\u0628\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0654\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 Google", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-04-25 03:17:20", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "video_url": null, "source_id": "google", "source_name": "Google News", "source_priority": 14, "source_url": "https://news.google.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/google.png", "language": "arabic", "country": ["saudi arabia"], "category": ["technology", "science"], "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "4941fa706b7e06689188462750803d6d", "title": "Eastspring Investments Berhad Launches Asian Low Volatility MY Fund", "link": "https://en.prnasia.com/story/486718-0.shtml", "keywords": ["mfd", "fnt", "fin", "cpr", "pdt"], "creator": null, "description": "New fund designed to help Malaysian investors navigate the current market environment with a focus on stability and risk mitigation. KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, April 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Eastspring Investments Berhad, part of Prudential plc, is pleased to announce the launch of the Eastspring Investments Asian Low Volatility Equity MY Fund (\"Fund\") in Malaysia. Mitigating Market Volatility with a Proven Strategy The Fund feeds into the Eastspring Investments - Asian Low Volatility Equity Fund (\"Target Fund\"), leveraging on this proven low volatility strategy, which has demonstrated resilience and consistent performance across various market conditions. As highlighted by Michael Sun, Director of Quant Capability at Eastspring Investments, the Asian Low Volatility Equity (\"ALVE\") strategy is well-suited to mitigate the volatility seen in today's markets. \"Eastspring's ALVE strategy has consistently provided robust downside protection while capturing as much of the market rally as possible. This is achieved through our systematic investment process, which adapts to market changes and dynamics, guiding us to invest in more resilient, less volatile names within sectors such as Financials, Utilities, Consumer Discretionary, and Industrials, and in markets such as China, Singapore and India\", said Michael Sun. Key Benefits of the Fund Resilient Returns Amid Market Ups and Downs: The Target Fund demonstrates lower volatility compared to its peers during market downturns. This encourages investors to stay invested, not miss the market's best days, and benefit from compounding. Differentiated Investment Process: The Target Fund selects stocks based on multiple factors, not just low volatility, to create a well-diversified and attractively valued portfolio. This approach is enhanced by quant style analysis, which incorporates factors such as low risk, quality, value, momentum and sentiment. Expertise: The Target Fund is managed by an experienced team, who has been managing Low Volatility strategies since 2013, with an AUM of USD603 million as of 30 November 2024. Navigating Trade Tensions and Geopolitical Risks The current market environment is characterised by significant uncertainty due to factors such as deglobalisation, trade tariff protectionism, and geopolitical tensions. Michael Sun noted that the ALVE strategy is well-positioned to provide resilience in such conditions. \"Our portfolio has underweight exposures to markets and sectors with higher US sales exposure, making it well-positioned to provide downside protection during trade tensions. By focusing on domestically oriented companies, the portfolio can offer resilience against export volatility.\" A Timely Solution for Investors \"As investors increasingly seek stability and risk mitigation without sacrificing returns, the Fund offers a timely solution. With the Target Fund's track record of consistent performance and effective risk management, this Fund is designed to meet the needs of investors looking for a reliable investment option in today's unpredictable market\", said Yap Siok Hoon, Chief Executive Officer of Eastspring Investments Berhad. The Fund is available through participating banks and Eastspring's licensed Unit Trust Consultants.

answers in the Bandung Spirit again The Chinese Delegation has come here to seek unity and not to quarrel, to seek common ground and not to create divergence. Seven decades ago, at the Bandung Conference, then Chinese Premier and Foreign Minister, Zhou Enlai, clearly stated the fundamental philosophy in China's diplomacy, which also set the tone for the Bandung Spirit. That was in 1955, a time when the world still suffered from the aftermath of the Second World War, and the United States and the Soviet Union were deep in rivalry. Amongst such a backdrop, 29 countries and regions from Asia and Africa initiated, convened, and attended the Bandung Conference. This conference and the Bandung Spirit which arose from it, signify the awakening of the Third World in political awareness. Asian and African countries who uphold nationalism stepped onto the international stage with an independent stance, and hand-in-hand, they started the chapter of South-South Cooperation. For 70 years, although there have been problems and tensions among the Global South countries, the major trend continues to be negotiations on equal stances, mutual help and unity in strength. From the Non-Aligned Movement and the G-77 in the 20th century, which respectively opposed camp confrontation and appealed to a new global economic order, to the rise of platforms including BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in the 21st century, the Global South countries have constantly voiced their collective concerns, and have become a force not to be neglected in the international arena. They are a driver of inclusive economic globalization, a builder of equal and orderly multi-polarization, and a proactive leader of mutual learning and communication among civilizations. Take the economy and trade front as an example, now the Global South accounts for over 40% of the world's GDP. From 2007 to 2023, South-South trade volume has increased from 2.3 trillion USD to 5.6 trillion USD. In the next five years, it is projected that the South-South trade will contribute about 70% of global economic growth. Seven decades have passed. In 2025, the world is faced with new factors that endanger stability. Liu Haifang, Professor at Peking University: I think the paramount spirit to take away from the Bandung Conference is to galvanize the once-colonized and weak countries into developing their own capabilities to keep independent and take initiative. So, faced with the challenges today, we may as well review the key takeaway from the Bandung Conference. Are we still able to safeguard a fair international order with joined hands? Are we developing countries still treating each other with an inclusive and open mindset where we seek common ground while shelving differences? 70 years ago, the Asian and African countries reached a consensus on independence and common development despite their different ideologies and social systems. 70 years later, with the pressure of development, countries all over the world can also think about how to forge new consensus amongst differences, and form institutional connections in negotiations. The Bandung Spirit has long transcended the framework of Asia-Africa cooperation and South-South Cooperation; it has in fact provided a timeless example for South-North cooperation and even global governance. The dynamism of current changes in the world originates from the South. We hope all the entities can follow the Bandung Spirit as guidance, and march towards modernization where there's independence and thriving progress.
