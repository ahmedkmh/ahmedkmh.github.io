Speaking during World Defense Show 2026, Mansour Al-Babtain, Vice President for Commercial Partnerships and Liaison at the World Defense Show, reflects on the show\u2019s growing international stature, its role in advancing Saudi Arabia\u2019s defense localization agenda, and how WDS is positioning itself as a serious, integrated platform for long-term industrial and strategic collaboration. Q1: World Defense Show has quickly established itself on the global defense calendar. From your perspective, what defines this edition of WDS?This edition reflects maturity. World Defense Show is no longer introducing itself to the global defense community; it is operating as a fully established platform. What defines WDS 2026 is the scale of engagement and the seriousness of intent we are seeing across government, industry, and international delegations. Crucially, it remains the only global defense exhibition structured around five fully integrated domains: air, land, sea, space, and security.From the outset, the Show has been designed around integration \u2014 not only across these five domains, but across people, institutions, and industry. That is particularly visible this year in the depth of dialogue, the quality of participation, and the outcomes emerging throughout the week.Q2: Many global defense exhibitions focus on scale or spectacle. How does WDS distinguish itself in practical terms?WDS distinguishes itself through operational realism and structure. It is a purpose-built venue that allows companies and delegations to see capabilities operating in realistic conditions, including live air displays, land demonstrations, unmanned systems, and integrated content programs, all within a single environment.This year, that operational realism is further enhanced through four new dedicated zones: the Future Defense Lab, the Saudi Supply Chain Zone, the Unmanned Systems Zone, and the Naval Zone. Each provides a focused environment where specific capabilities can be demonstrated, assessed, and discussed in context.That matters because defense decision-making today is increasingly about systems working together, not standalone platforms. WDS moves the conversation beyond brochures and static displays into something tangible and credible.Q3: What does the level of international participation at WDS say about Saudi Arabia\u2019s position in the global defense ecosystem today?It reflects confidence. International companies and delegations participate where they see long-term opportunity and seriousness of purpose. The breadth of participation at WDS \u2014 with exhibitors from more than 80 countries, spanning established defense primes, technology providers, SMEs, and innovators \u2014 signals that Saudi Arabia is viewed as a central and credible player in the global defense and security landscape.Importantly, this participation is not symbolic. It is structured around engagement, dialogue, and partnership exploration, which is what gives the Show its relevance beyond the exhibition halls.Q4: World Defense Show is closely aligned with Vision 2030. How does that alignment translate in practice during the Show?Vision 2030 is ultimately about building sustainable capability \u2014 economic, industrial, and human. WDS supports that by acting as a platform where those elements intersect.From an economic perspective, the Show contributes directly to GDP and employment. The previous edition generated approximately SAR 500 million in GDP impact and supported more than 4,600 jobs across event delivery, services, logistics, and the wider ecosystem. This year builds on that trajectory, with the Show now spanning 273,000 square meters across four fully sold-out exhibition halls, alongside significantly expanded participation and programming.At the same time, WDS creates visibility and access by connecting Saudi entities with international partners, investors, and technology providers within a structured and transparent environment.Q5: Localization is a national priority, led by the General Authority for Military Industries. What role does WDS play in supporting that agenda?WDS does not define localization policy; that role sits clearly with the General Authority for Military Industries. What WDS does is provide the platform that enables those conversations to happen efficiently and credibly.The Kingdom has made substantial progress, reaching 24.89% defense localization by the end of 2024, demonstrating clear momentum toward the Vision 2030 target of 50%. WDS supports that trajectory by bringing together the entire ecosystem \u2014 Saudi industry, international companies, supply-chain players, technology providers, investors, and decision-makers \u2014 in one place.Localization outcomes emerge from these interactions, but the value of WDS lies in convening the right stakeholders and creating visibility around opportunity at scale.Q6: The Saudi Supply Chain Zone has been a visible feature at this year\u2019s Show. Why is this important from WDS\u2019s perspective?The Saudi Supply Chain Zone reflects the practical side of engagement. With 57 Saudi companies participating, it creates a dedicated environment where Saudi SMEs and industrial players can connect directly with international primes, systems integrators, and potential partners.From WDS\u2019s perspective, it is about creating structured visibility and access, allowing conversations around capability, partnership models, and supply-chain integration to happen efficiently and transparently. The Zone facilitates supplier qualification discussions, joint venture exploration, and technology collaboration pathways that support the broader localization agenda.While the Show does not lead localization policy, it plays an important enabling role by bringing the ecosystem together in one place.Q7: Beyond exhibitions and demonstrations, how important are the leadership and content programs at WDS?They are critical. Defense today is as much about strategy, integration, and resilience as it is about hardware. The leadership discussions and content theaters provide context, helping participants understand how capabilities fit into wider operational, economic, and geopolitical realities.The programs address real-world challenges, including multi-domain integration, operational resilience, AI and autonomous systems, cyber defense, and the shift toward co-development and localization. They elevate the quality of engagement by enabling structured exchanges between policymakers, industry leaders, and innovators.Q8: Talent development has featured strongly at WDS this year. Why is that significant?Long-term capability depends on people. The Future Talent Program reflects a clear recognition that defense ecosystems are built not only on technology, but on skills, education, and human capital.By exposing Saudi students and young professionals to real industry environments \u2014 including engineering, advanced manufacturing, innovation, and emerging technologies \u2014 the Show supports workforce readiness and awareness, complementing national efforts to build a future-ready talent pipeline aligned with Vision 2030.Q9: From your vantage point, what does success look like for World Defense Show beyond headline announcements?Success is measured by continuity. It is not just about what is announced during the week, but about what continues afterward \u2014 partnerships that progress, discussions that deepen, and relationships that evolve into long-term collaboration.Previous editions of WDS facilitated multi-billion-riyal agreements and industrial partnerships, many of which have matured into operational programs, joint ventures, and technology collaborations. That continuity is the true measure of impact.Q10: Looking ahead, how do you see World Defense Show evolving over the coming editions?The evolution of the Show will continue to be guided by relevance rather than size alone. As defense technologies, supply chains, and partnership models evolve, WDS will continue adapting its programs, platforms, and structure to reflect those shifts.The objective remains consistent: to provide a serious, international platform that supports integration, industrial development, and long-term collaboration, aligned with Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambitions and the needs of the global defense community.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["business"], "creator": ["\u2014"], "language": "english", "country": ["saudi arabia"], "category": ["business"], "datatype": "news", "pubDate": "2026-02-09 06:00:04", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "fetched_at": "2026-02-09 06:11:52", "image_url": "https://saudigazette.com.sa/saudigazette/uploads/images/2026/02/09/2659714.webp", "video_url": null, "source_id": "saudigazette", "source_name": "Saudi Gazette", "source_priority": 356263, "source_url": "https://saudigazette.com.sa", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/saudigazette.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "510bc0def77d0912c39a1cb7ca66677c", "link": "https://en.prnasia.com/story/521810-0.shtml", "title": "Agoda Unveils Asia's Top Onsen Destinations", "description": "SINGAPORE, Feb. 9, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital travel platform Agoda has released its list of the top destinations in Asia for onsen hot spring activities, with Osaka taking the crown, based on activity bookings made on Agoda in January 2026.

settlements", "description": "JERUSALEM \u2014 The Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Islamic resistance movement Hamas have condemened new measures adopted by Israel on Sunday aimed at exapanding illegal settlement activity in the occupied West Bank.Hamas said the new decisions approved by Israel\u2019s security cabinet earlier on Sudnay are intended to swallow up all Palestinian land and displace its original inhabitants.The Israeli decisions include repealing a Jordanian-era law barring the sale of Palestinian land to Jews, unsealing land ownership records, and transferring building permit authority in a Hebron settlement bloc from the Palestinian municipality to Israel\u2019s civil administration, Israeli media reported.Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said in a statement that the settlement-related decisions taken by Israel\u2019s government \u201cconfirm its colonial program aimed at swallowing all Palestinian land and displacing its original inhabitants,\u201d calling the moves a \u201creal existential threat.\u201dQassem said Israel\u2019s far-right government is seeking to expand what he described as a war of annihilation and to eliminate the Palestinian presence across all Palestinian geography.He added that the developments require practical Palestinian unity and a national response to confront Israel\u2019s aggressive policies.Meanwhie, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's office said described the Israli decisions as \"illegal, null and void,\" saying that they constitute \"the practical implementation of annexation and displacement plans\" and violate agreements signed between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel, international law and UN resolutions, according to official news agency WAFA.The Palestinians presidency called on the international community to intervene immediately to halt the measures, which it said threaten efforts to reduce regional tensions.The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also condemned Israel's \"desperate attempts\" to alter the legal status and character of the occupied Palestinian territory, calling the actions \"criminal.\"\"Israel has no sovereignty over any of the occupied Palestinian territories or cities ... has no legal right to repeal or amend existing laws, including Jordanian laws and legislation that are part of the Palestinian legal system,\" the ministry said.Palestinian officials have repeatedly warned that measures expanding settlements and extending Israeli civilian authority in the West Bank undermine prospects for a future Palestinian state.The UN says Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory are illegal under international law and undermine the viability of a two-state solution and has for decades called for an end to settlement activity. \u2014 Agencies", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["\u0622\u062e\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631"], "creator":
