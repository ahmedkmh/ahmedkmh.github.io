At the heart of French gastronomy, cheese is more than just food, it's a symbol of tradition, craft, and cultural pride. With over 3,000 varieties across different regions, French cheeses reflect centuries of know-how passed down through generations. From soft, buttery Bries to aged, nutty Comte\u0301 and vibrant orange-hued Mimolette, these cheeses tell the story of terroir, craftsmanship, and passion. This campaign focuses on cow's milk cheeses, which form the backbone of French cheesemaking and are loved around the world for their diversity in texture and flavor. \"This campaign has been an exciting three-year journey of culinary connection between France and Singapore,\" says E\u0301milie Martin, Managing Director of CNIEL. \"With this final edition, we are proud to showcase how French cheese can find a home in everyday local dishes, thanks to the creativity of chefs, students, and food lovers here.\" Over the past three years, we've brought together chefs, importers, distributors, students, and food lovers in a journey of culinary fusion, training the next generation of local chefs from institutions like ITE, At-Sunrice, and SHATEC, and educating key industry players on the incredible variety and possibilities of French cheese. This year marks the culmination of that journey, with a fresh and exciting spotlight on local food and hawker-inspired dishes. From chili crab toast topped with Mimolette to baked brie sate\u0301, this year's events showcase how street-style eats can be redefined using classic French cheese. World-renowned cheesemonger Franc\u0327ois Robin, Meilleur Ouvrier de France, returns to lead this year's experience with a bold new message: \"French cheeses have all the qualities needed to be the perfect boost for texture and flavour in Singaporean classic dishes or snacks: their creaminess is always a plus, they melt beautifully when heated, and they act as excellent aroma fixers, capturing the sharpness of Asian ingredients. They're also well-balanced and minimally processed, the list of assets is long. And perhaps the most important of all: French cheeses are simply delicious!\" says Franc\u0327ois Robin. Throughout this campaign, we continue to spotlight the diversity of French cheese, from the luscious richness of Triple Cre\u0300me, to the earthy elegance of Fourme d'Ambert, to the iconic soft bloom of Camembert and how these traditional products can embrace Southeast Asia's street food culture with creativity and flair. To bring this fusion to life, we're also sharing an original recipe that reimagines one of Singapore's most iconic dishes, Chili Crab, with a French twist. Featuring French Mimolette, this recipe shows just how effortlessly cow's milk cheese can be woven into local favourites, adding depth, creaminess, and character to beloved flavours. CHILLI CRAB TOASTS Crispy air-fried mantou buns topped with a spicy crab salad and finished with nutty Mimolette cheese. Spice meets sophistication: Chilli Crab Toasts topped with rich French Mimolette \u2014 where bold heat and nutty cheese melt into every bite. Why the pairing works: Mimolette's savoury-sweet notes echo the essence of chilli crab. Its deep orange hue and firm texture make a bold visual and flavour contrast to the crab and chilli tomato jam, with belachan adding umami depth.

This year campaign includes: A Trade & Media Tasting Showcase featuring elevated local bites and local drinks reimagined with French cheeses, demonstrating creative applications for foodservice professionals and media. Culinary School Workshops led by Maryjoy Lym from Jag Restaurant, where students from top Singaporean institutions will explore the tradition behind french cheese, how to create modern cheese board and remix local food using French cheese.
