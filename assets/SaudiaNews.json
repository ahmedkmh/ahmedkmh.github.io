Chery Group and UNICEF Signing Ceremony Building on its initial contribution of US$ 6 million for 2023-2025, Chery Group has pledged an additional US$ 6 million over the next three years to further support UNICEF's education programs, both globally and with dedicated support to China, Mexico, South Africa, Tu\u0308rkiye, Indonesia, and Vietnam. UNICEF estimates that hundreds of millions of children worldwide still lack access to quality education. Over 600 million are unable to attain minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics, even though two thirds of them are in school. For those out of school, foundational literacy and numeracy remain out of reach. Educational inequality continues to hinder global progress, with children affected by poverty, conflict, disasters, disabilities, or living in remote and marginalized communities most at risk of being left behind. Since the partnership was first established in 2023, Chery Group has provided vital support to UNICEF's global education programmes. Chery contributed to UNICEF reaching nearly 40 million children and adolescents with access to quality education, including 17 million in emergencies. Building on this significant impact and in response to the ongoing global learning crisis, both parties have pledged to extend their partnership through 2028, deepening their shared commitment to empowering the next generation. Chery Group Presents Donation Check to UNICEF Chery Group's renewed commitment of US$6 million will support UNICEF's global education programmes to provide access to quality education for the most disadvantaged and marginalised children, and to help countries strengthen their national education systems to create lasting change for children at scale. Yin Tongyue, Chairman of Chery Group, stated at the renewal ceremony: \"Chery Group has consistently placed corporate social responsibility at the core of its development. We are not just an automobile manufacturer - we are committed contributors to global sustainable development. The achievements of our collaboration over the past two years have strengthened our belief in advancing global education with UNICEF. By renewing this vital partnership, Chery Group will continue to mobilize global resources, collaborate with partners from all sectors, and contribute efforts to promote social progress and help build a more inclusive future.\" \"Chery's commitment to innovation, social responsibility, and global impact is truly inspiring,\" said Dr. Myo-Zin Nyunt, Deputy Regional Director of UNICEF East Asia and Pacific Regional Office. \"We look forward to deepening our collaboration and creating even greater opportunities for children everywhere. On behalf of UNICEF and the millions of lives of children you've touched - thank you for your trust, your vision, and your unwavering support. Together, we can build a brighter, more equitable future for every child.\" With Chery Group's support, UNICEF has made remarkable progress during the first two years of the partnership, delivering quality education to tens of millions of out-of-school children, including children with disabilities, displaced children, and those affected by emergencies. With Chery Group's renewed commitment, this transformative work will continue in China, Mexico, South Africa, and Tu\u0308rkiye, and expand to Viet Nam and Indonesia. These programmes focus on fostering inclusive, healthy, and safe learning environments, ensuring that more children and adolescents gain access to equitable and quality educational opportunities. Chery Group has consistently integrated the principles of sustainable development into its strategy and operations. The renewal of its partnership with UNICEF marks not only a significant milestone in Chery's long-term commitment to social responsibility, but also a concrete step towards fulfilling its promise of \"building a better future for the next generation\". By joining forces and leveraging education as a catalyst, Chery Group will continue to stand alongside global partners like UNICEF to advance a more equitable, resilient, and human-centered vision of sustainable development worldwide.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-10-20 03:26:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url":

movie-inspired collaboration package - NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Nongshim carried out a global campaign at New York Times Square to celebrate the launch of Shin Ramyun in collaboration with Netflix's hit animated film 'KPop Demon Hunters'. As known for \"The Crossroads of the World\" and attracting over 450,000 visitors daily, Times Square served as the stage for global consumers to directly taste and enjoy the Shin Ramyun brand through a variety of interactive activities that seamlessly connected both online and offline experiences. Nongshim Shin Ramyun Advertising and On-site Event at New York Times Square (1) On the day of the campaign, Nongshim unveiled the 'KPop Demon Hunters'-inspired Shin Ramyun through a giant Digital Out-of-Home (DOOH) billboard in Times Square. In addition to the digital billboard, Nongshim also operated a range of themed booths to let visitors experience the Shin Ramyun brand firsthand. At the Food Zone, visitors sampled Shin Toomba prepared with an instant noodle cooker, offering a taste of Korea's iconic \"Hangang Ramyun\" culture alongside Shrimp Crackers. The Reward Zone featured instant photo booths decorated with 'KPop Demon Hunters' characters, while the Event Zone offered prizes, including Shin Ramyun, through a social media follow event that extended the excitement online. A Nongshim representative commented, \"This campaign went beyond simple digital advertising to become a festival where global consumers could directly taste and enjoy Shin Ramyun. Starting from New York Times Square, we will continue to connect directly with consumers worldwide and actively spread Shin Ramyun's global slogan, 'Spicy Happiness In Noodles.'\" Meanwhile, Nongshim has been rolling out the 'KPop Demon Hunters'-inspired packaging globally since late August, starting in Korea. In the Americas, including the United States, sales began in mid-September, with distribution gradually expanding to additional countries. Nongshim also plans to introduce the product across key European markets \u2014 including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, and the Czech Republic \u2014 as well as in Australia and New Zealand within this year.
