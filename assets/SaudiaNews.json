on an Interstellar Journey in the Name of Love", "description": "TAIPEI, Feb. 8, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- WePlay, a global next-generation social entertainment platform, today announced a strategic partnership with \"The Little Prince,\" a French literary classic IP, to launch a special Valentine's Day activity themed \"Will's Interstellar Journey.\" Running from February 8 to February 14, the campaign invites Taiwan users to reinterpret the meanings of \"companionship,\" \"taming,\" and \"being seen\" through gameplay interactions, drawing inspiration from the Little Prince's worldview of love. WePlay Partners with \"The Little Prince\" to Launch 2026 Valentine's Day Special Activity,Embark on an Interstellar Journey in the Name of Love A Cross-Boundary Fusion of Classic Literature and Social Entertainment \"The Little Prince\" is a novella created and published by French writer Antoine de Saint-Exupe\u0301ry in 1943. With global sales exceeding 140 million copies and translations into over 650 languages and dialects, it ranks as the second-most published book globally, surpassed only by the Bible. Through simple yet philosophically rich prose, the work explores eternal themes including loneliness, friendship, love, and loss, deeply resonating with readers of all ages worldwide. 2026 marks the 80th anniversary of \"The Little Prince's\" publication in France. WePlay has chosen this special occasion to launch this collaborative activity, aiming to combine the novel's core concept of \"taming creates bonds\" with modern social entertainment scenarios through interactive gameplay experiences. The goal is to provide users with a creative feast that blends emotional value with entertainment experience. Multi-Dimensional Interactive Gameplay: Igniting Valentine's Day Conversations This activity features five core gameplay mechanics, each corresponding to classic imagery and emotional scenes from the Little Prince story: \"Rose Wishes\" \u2014 Exclusive Confession Gifts When users send \"Rose Wishes,\" they have the opportunity to trigger limited romantic gift effects and full-screen red envelope rain. This gameplay aims to strengthen the ceremonial significance of confession moments, ensuring every heartfelt message is seen and commemorated across the entire server. \"Little Prince's Diary\" \u2014 Planetary Story Unlocking When players send \"Little Prince's Diary\" gifts, they encounter mysterious wanderer characters and progressively unlock planetary storyline rewards. Additionally, there's a chance to obtain SS-tier PLAY show exclusive items and full-screen name card backgrounds, deeply integrating story unlocking with interactive socialization. \"Secret of Planet B-612\" \u2014 Blind Box Adventure Mechanism Users unlock memory fragments through opening blind boxes, progressively revealing exclusive Little Prince PLAY show items and rare co-branded gifts and rewards. \"Cloud Vows\" \u2014 Dual-Player Interactive Intimacy Gameplay Couple users can participate together, completing tasks collectively to accumulate \"rapport values,\" progressively unlocking couple rewards and romantic chapters that make love stories more three-dimensional and profound through game interaction. \"Light-Year Love\" and \"Together Forever\" \u2014 Server-Wide Witness Mechanism Sending \"Light-Year Love\" gifts grants special homepage effects, while \"Together Forever\" provides full-server barrage highlight display opportunities. Both mechanics reinforce WePlay's platform value proposition of \"letting love be witnessed by the entire universe.\" WePlay's Global IP Strategy As the flagship product under WEJOY PTE. LTD., headquartered in Singapore, WePlay is dedicated to building a social entertainment ecosystem that brings \"joy and friendship to young people worldwide.\" Since its launch, the platform has achieved significant success across multiple regional markets including Japan, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan region, and the Middle East, accumulating over 800 million downloads with monthly active users in the millions. Previously, WePlay collaborated with renowned IPs including \"Care Bears,\" \"Chibi Maruko-chan,\" \"Kumamon,\" \"Peach Cat,\" and \"Nailoong.\" Each collaboration strengthened the platform's brand impression as \"innovative, warm, and culturally deep.\" This partnership with \"The Little Prince\" represents a further upgrade in WePlay's global IP collaboration strategy, not only selecting classic IPs with global influence but also creatively fusing the IP's spiritual essence with social entertainment experiences. Localization Significance in the Taiwan Market Taiwan, as a key market for WePlay, has consistently demonstrated high user activity and cultural resonance. According to WePlay's official data, the platform has established a stable presence in the top positions of Taiwan's App Store and Google Play free charts, with users primarily consisting of 18-25-year-old young social entertainment consumers. This Valentine's Day activity specifically considered Taiwan users' aesthetic preferences and emotional expression habits, implementing localization adaptations across gameplay mechanics, copy tone, and visual presentation. WePlay's team stated that they hope this collaboration will provide Taiwan's young users with a new social interaction scenario where they can \"play games, express emotions, and be seen.\" Dual-Driven Cultural and Commercial Value WePlay's Taiwan market director stated: \"Choosing to launch this collaboration on the 80th anniversary of 'The Little Prince's' French publication is no coincidence. The Little Prince story is essentially about 'connection', deep linkages between people, between souls. This perfectly aligns with WePlay's mission to 'make the world more exciting through interaction.' In an increasingly competitive social entertainment landscape, we believe that mere functional stacking and discounts are insufficient to win users' hearts. We aim to introduce culturally deep IPs with global resonance points, elevating virtual social interaction into carriers of emotional attachment and cultural expression. Valentine's Day itself is inherently about 'being seen,' and WePlay's social mechanisms are perfectly positioned to realize this.\" About WePlay WePlay is a global next-generation social entertainment platform under WEJOY PTE.
