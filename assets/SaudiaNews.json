A lawyer by profession, he was elected in 2022 as one of 16 representatives in the lower chamber to represent the more than 9 million victims of Colombia's decades-long armed conflict.His party, the U Party, expressed their remorse for his death and said he was \u201ca leader committed to his region, with a firm vocation for service.\u201d\"I am deeply saddened by these deaths. My heartfelt condolences to their families.
