The investment will support ArmourZero's expansion across ASEAN, North Asia, and West Asia (the Middle East), opening new doors for enterprises and building stronger trust with regional clients. ArmourZero CEO and Co-Founder Tho Kit Hoong together with YTM Colonel(H) Tunku Syed Razman Ibni Tunku Syed Idrus Al Qadri, marking ArmourZero\u2019s new strategic investment. \"Often we are mistaken as a reseller that resells other solutions or a service-oriented company instead of a deep-tech cybersecurity product company. Cybersecurity threats are evolving faster than ever, and organisations need intelligent, automated solutions to respond in real time. This partnership accelerates ArmourZero's ability to reach key markets and build strategic relationships, ensuring our AI-driven solutions can deliver tangible impact where it matters most in particular when it comes to application security,\" said Tho Kit Hoong, Co-founder & CEO of ArmourZero. YTM Colonel(H) Tunku Syed Razman Ibni Tunku Syed Idrus Al Qadri, who chairs the Malaysia-Saudi Arabia Business Council (MSBC), commented: \"ArmourZero is addressing a critical gap in cybersecurity with a strong AI-driven approach to safeguard all business applications. Our investment reflects confidence in their technology and its potential to set new standards in automated application security for the region.\" AI and the Rising Urgency in Cybersecurity Artificial intelligence has accelerated innovation in software development, with 84% of developers now using AI-generated code (often referred to as \"vibe coding\") to build faster while increasing exposure to potential vulnerabilities. A 2025 study by Schreiber & Tippe analysing 7,703 AI-generated code files found over 4,200 distinct vulnerabilities across 77 weakness types, with Python-based code showing vulnerability rates up to 18%. As AI becomes embedded in modern development workflows, the risk of introducing exploitable flaws into production systems continues to grow. At the same time, IBM's 2025 Cost of a Data Breach Report found that organisations using AI and automation in their security operations reduced average breach costs by up to USD 1.9 million compared to those without such technologies, underscoring the value of proactive, technology-driven security. These findings highlight why AI and automation security are essential for modern software development. By applying AI to guide remediation and verify potential vulnerabilities, ArmourZero enables businesses to strengthen application security with greater speed and confidence. Continuous Innovation ArmourZero continues to advance its technology roadmap to address emerging enterprise risks. As part of its commitment to strengthening organisational resilience, the company will launch its API Security solution this month, addressing one of the most critical blind spots by empowering software developers and cybersecurity teams to automatically discover and remediate API related vulnerabilities early and prevent costly breaches before they impact operations. About ArmourZero ArmourZero's Automated Vulnerability Management (AVM) platform provides real-time vulnerability discovery across applications, web domains, and cloud infrastructures. The platform provides AI to accelerate remediation through intelligent suggestions and advanced false-positive detection. This enables the software developer teams, risk teams, and cybersecurity teams to collaborate closely, focus on genuine threats and resolve them more efficiently.

Held under the theme \"Steering Sustainability through Changes\", the forum brought together global maritime leaders to explore coordinated pathways for decarbonisation and digital transformation. During the forum, two major industry group standards were officially released. Developed jointly by multiple authoritative organisations with strong involvement from MVGX, the standards are: Calculation Methods for Life Cycle GHG Intensity of Marine Fuels and Verification for Attained Annual Greenhouse Gas Fuel Intensity of Ships. These two standards address critical gaps in the industry's methodologies for low-carbon accounting and verification of marine fuels. Each standard introduces a systematic approach for calculating and verifying full life-cycle emissions, covering the entire process from raw material acquisition and production to transportation, storage, and onboard use. Together, the standards provide the sector with unified, scientific, and actionable technical frameworks. This alignment also brings domestic regulations closer to IMO rules, strengthening China's technical influence in global green maritime governance. The calculation standard offers structured support for fuel pathway assessment and emissions reduction strategy development, while the verification standard provides a complete framework for compliance assurance. The release of this standards series lays a quantitative foundation for the sector, while also builds momentum for the upcoming global launch of OptiFuel EU and AIPoS Platform. Designed in line with tightening global environmental regulations and the maritime sector's accelerating green transition, the OptiFuel EU fully complies with the FuelEU and the EU ETS. Its intelligent algorithms optimise fuel use and fuel mix, reducing both fuel-related expenses and regulatory compliance costs with precision. Meanwhile, AIPoS Platform streamlines sustainability data management by automating the tracking, processing, and intelligent analysis of marine fuel data. This provides maritime enterprises with a strong data-driven foundation for strategic decarbonisation decisions. By aligning closely with industry standards, these two products offer maritime enterprises worldwide a comprehensive solution that supports compliance, cost optimisation, and operational efficiency. MVGX aims to help the sector move towards a more efficient, transparent, and sustainable future. More information on the global launch of both products will be shared soon.

The session brought together leaders from urban planning, business, and the community to explore how cities can better support cognitive diversity and mental well-being. Neurodesign Roundtable Panellists \u2014 Re-thinking Urban Spaces: Designing Cities for Every Mind With 15-20% of the global population being neurodivergent, and brain-related conditions projected to cost the world US$16 trillion by 2030, designing for cognitive inclusion is not only a moral imperative it is an economic strategy. The newly launched report \u2013 Re-thinking Urban Spaces: Designing Cities for Every Mind \u2013 builds on global insights into the emerging Brain Economy, where nations increasingly compete over cognitive capital the capacity to learn, innovate, and adapt rather than solely on resources or data. Hazleen Ahmad, Founder of Neuropower World, Deputy CEO of the Institute of Neurodiversity (ION), and Chair & Founder of ION Singapore, also shared during the World Economic Forum Riyadh session, Unlocking Human Potential in the Age of Cognitive Capital, \"Every brain accommodated is a mind activated, and every mind activated is a new frontier of growth. By designing for both neurohealth and neurosensory needs, we unlock human potential and build resilient, creative, humane nations.\" Charlotte Valeur, Founder of the Institute of Neurodiversity (ION), added, \"Designing for neuroinclusion is designing for humanity. The Institute of Neurodiversity is proud to see Singapore taking a leading role in embedding neurodesign into how we plan, build, and live. This is not just about accommodating difference, it is about building systems that recognise the full spectrum of human potential.\" Key Insights from the Report include: Designing for neurodivergent needs creates environments that benefit everyone Inclusive design supports well-being across all ages, from children to seniors Choice features, such as dimmable lighting and quiet areas, should become basic standards Urban planning is a public health tool that can reduce stress and cognitive overload Becoming a \"Well Nation\" would build mental health and inclusion into everyday life Seven Pillars of Neurodesign: Sensory Load; Arousal Regulation & Choice; Wayfinding & Predictability; Attention & Restoration; Aesthetics & Emotion; Social & Psychological Safety; and Cognitive Load & Comprehension Cross-sector collaboration is essential for designing resilient, human-centred cities Pilot projects and training programmes will test Singapore's potential as a global leader in neuroinclusive urban design As Hazleen Ahmad further shared, \"When we observe nature, we gain insight into human-centred design. For example, the Kingfisher inspired Japanese Shinkansen engineers to reshape the train's nose, reducing noise and improving aerodynamics. Similarly, by studying human cognition and neurodiversity, neurodesign helps us create urban systems that are faster, kinder, and designed for everyone.\" Kay Sargent, Bestselling Author and Senior Principal, Director of Thought Leadership, Interiors \u2013 HOK, shared, \"A growing percentage of individuals consider themselves neurodivergent, one in five people. Yet our cities and systems are rarely designed with these minds in mind. Neurodesign helps us build environments that support dignity, focus, and inclusion.\" Future-ready cities are designed for the full range of human cognition, and neurodesign turns this vision into reality. Re-thinking Urban Spaces: Designing Cities for Every Mind marks an opportunity for Singapore to evolve from a Smart Nation and City in Nature into a Well Nation, where mental health and inclusion are built into urban life through cross-sector collaboration in planning, public health, and education.
