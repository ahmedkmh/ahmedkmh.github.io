SINGAPORE, July 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie employees in Asia participated in the tenth Week of Possibilities (WOP), the AbbVie Foundation's annual global volunteering programme, held in June and July. This unites our employees around the world with a single purpose to serve our local communities. 880 employees across Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, India, Taiwan region, and South Korea came together to engage in services tailored to the needs of their local communities through volunteer initiatives. Projects focused on supporting vulnerable groups, children, seniors, and individuals with health and social vulnerabilities. \"Our people power the change we want to see in the world. Through Week of Possibilities, we're proud to stand alongside our partners across Asia to support the communities we live and work in, especially those who are often overlooked. Whether it's helping children, seniors, people with disabilities, or protecting our environment, every action brings us closer to a more equitable, healthier future,\" said Peggy Wu, Vice President, Asia, AbbVie. In Thailand, employees focused on supporting students in a rural community with limited resources by rebuilding unsafe classrooms, providing lunches, and donating essentials. In the Philippines, volunteers contributed to food rescue efforts, preparing meals for communities with unmet needs and hosting a special Kasama Ka programme to raise awareness around food security and sustainability. The India team led a month-long series of engagements: organising a sports day for children experiencing homelessness in Mumbai, visiting a senior home for musical games and companionship, conducting art-based environmental workshops with children from low-income communities in Bangalore, and running a personal hygiene session at a children's home in Delhi. In Taiwan region and Malaysia, inclusive events such as stage performances, craft-making, and cycling activities empowered individuals with disabilities through confidence-building experiences. In Korea, employees supported people with disabilities through community outings, pop art portraits, and eco-friendly installations at care facilities. In Singapore, employees fostered social connections with seniors and vulnerable individuals through creative activities and heritage tours, while also supporting environmental sustainability through waterways clean-ups. \"We are deeply impressed by the passion and dedication of AbbVie volunteers, who actively participated and joyfully accompanied the disabled. This companionship brings not only encouragement but also respect and acceptance. Every time the volunteers cheer for the disabled, they help our foundation in promoting a more friendly treatment for people with disabilities,\" said Li Shu Yu, staff member of the Eden Social Welfare Foundation, Taiwan. Together, the WOP initiatives in Asia spanned healthcare, education, elderly support, environmental protection, and disability inclusion, reflecting the diverse needs of communities and the breadth of AbbVie's commitment. At the heart of every activity was a shared belief that health equity starts with local action and that everyone has equal access to the opportunity to thrive. Claire Chin, Area Head, Regulatory Affairs, AbbVie, shared, \"June has always been my favourite month of the year at AbbVie. This year's theme for AbbVie's week of possibilities is advancing health equity. A lot of people might think of health equity as hospital visits and other charitable events. But in developed countries like Singapore, we tend to take our clean environment for granted. Before we consider advanced technologies and treatment options to support health, we have to first fulfil the basic human needs of hygiene, good health, and a good environment. To me, that's where we can start to work towards creating a healthy living environment for each of us.\" Launched in 2014, AbbVie's Week of Possibilities has grown into a cornerstone of the company's global culture, engaging employees in voluntary actions and an annual celebration of giving back. Powered in part by the AbbVie Foundation, the initiative rallies employees worldwide to volunteer and make a meaningful impact in the communities where they live and work.

Ziresovir, developed by Shanghai Ark Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (\"ArkBio\"), is the first and only RSV antiviral drug to be included in the list. This is the first time WHO has included an anti-RSV drug developed from China in the paediatric drug optimization priority list. Filling a Global Gap: Ziresovir Leads RSV Antiviral Development RSV is the leading pathogen of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in infants and young children globally, causing approximately 33 million cases of LRTIs, 3.6 million hospitalizations, and 101,400 deaths annually, with 97% of deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite the severe threat, current specific treatment options for RSV are extremely limited, and there is a clinical urgent need for safe, effective, and child-appropriate innovative drugs. The \"Paediatric drug optimization for respiratory syncytial virus (PADO-RSV)\" project initiated by WHO/GAP-f aims to systematically review the global R&D pipeline, clarify R&D priorities, and promote the development and accessibility of RSV prevention and treatment tools more suitable for the paediatric population. With its clear clinical value, child-friendly design, and good safety profile, ziresovir becomes the only product in the antiviral drug category selected for the PADO-RSV priority list, demonstrating its huge potential in the paediatric RSV treatment globally. WHO pointed out in the report that ziresovir's research results are of great significance to the global RSV treatment field and recommended conducting diverse clinical studies in broader populations to further verify its applicability and effectiveness. ArkBio will actively respond to WHO's advice with a plan to expand ziresovir's clinical development in other countries and regions. By collaborating with international scientific institutions and public health organizations, ArkBio aims to rapidly advance the drug's global registration and accessibility. Simultaneously, ArkBio is deeply aware of the importance of global public health, particularly concerned about the challenges faced by low- and middle-income countries. The company will formulate drug accessibility plans specifically for these countries to ensure ziresovir can be supplied at reasonable prices globally wherever it is needed, contributing to the prevention and treatment of RSV infection. \"ArkBio has a mission to 'help patients inspire and thrive'\", Dr. Jim Wu, CEO of ArkBio, stated. \"The inclusion of ziresovir in the WHO PADO-RSV priority list is not only an affirmation of the years of effort by ArkBio scientists, but also an inspiration for our corporate mission. The recognition of ziresovir would allow us to expedite its global development and realize the potential on the global stage. We will ensure the innovation can not only benefit patients in China but the very needed patients worldwide. This is not just our goal but our social responsibility. ArkBio will strive to contribute more to address global public health issues.\" About GAP-f GAP-f stands for the Global Accelerator for Paediatric Formulations Network. Hosted by WHO, it operates throughout the drug development lifecycle to accelerate the research, development, and dissemination of optimized pediatric formulations. Identifying priorities is the first step toward a targeted R&D approach. Establishing a priority list of the most urgently needed pediatric formulations is crucial, as it helps focus the efforts and resources of researchers and suppliers on specific dosage forms and formulations that address children's most critical needs. About PADO PADO stands for Paediatric Drug Optimization. It is a WHO's legally binding international priority (based on WHA69.20 resolution) that accelerates the development of high-demand pediatric drugs by building consensus among regulators, funders, and manufacturers. It aims to identify priority products for R&D and define their ideal characteristics. It has been successfully implemented in areas including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C, tuberculosis, COVID-19, antibiotics, neglected tropical diseases, and childhood cancers. These initiatives demonstrate that, against the backdrop of a fragmented and small pediatric drug market, such efforts hold potential and deliver tangible impacts in accelerating access to optimized formulations. About Ziresovir Ziresovir is a novel small-molecule RSV fusion (F) protein inhibitor. It binds to the pre-F protein conformation of the virus and prevents viral entry into human cells. Ziresovir can also suppress RSV viral transmission by blocking cell-to-cell fusion through the formation of \"syncytia\", a characteristic event of RSV infection of host cells. It is the first oral anti-RSV drug that has completed a phase 3 pivotal clinical study with positive results. The phase 3 results have been published in The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health. Ziresovir has received Breakthrough Therapy designation by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China.

Starting in early 2026, the architecture will be introduced gradually in mobility services at 50 locations across Japan as part of a large-scale demonstration to evaluate its real-world performance and capabilities. Publicly available via Autoware*, open-source software for autonomous driving championed by TIER IV, the newly developed architecture applies diffusion model-based machine learning to a sequence of driving tasks, including prediction of surrounding objects and generation of vehicle trajectories. This allows the system to imitate human-like driving behavior, even in highly complex scenarios such as obstacle avoidance or turning at busy intersections. In parallel, rule-based components are integrated to ensure high interpretability and operational stability. This hybrid approach combines the adaptability of learning-based methods with the reliability of deterministic logic, positioning the architecture as a practical and promising foundation for Level 4+ autonomy. To accelerate model development, TIER IV is taking advantage of Autoware's modular architecture and simulation environment to automatically generate large-scale synthetic training data. Combined with real-world data, this approach has resulted in the efficient construction of high-performance models with both scalability and reliability. TIER IV will continue to expand its training datasets and enhance model performance to further improve the robustness of the architecture. A variety of data-centric AI models will also be explored and integrated to ensure adaptability across a wide range of use cases, from privately owned cars to commercial vehicles for mobility and logistics services. Through the development of Level 4+ autonomy, TIER IV aims to help tackle major challenges in Japan, including the revitalization of regional communities and strengthening of industrial competitiveness. *Autoware is a registered trademark of The Autoware Foundation.

It has continuously strengthened the Party's leadership over urban affairs, upheld the principle that cities should be built by and for the people, and forged a path of urban development with Chinese characteristics. Staying true to the essence of a people-centered city \"People-centered development must be carried out in urban construction, and cities must be built for the people.\" Urban development follows a natural and historical process governed by its own logic. \"Respect the laws of urban development\" - this is a fundamental approach advocated by Xi in guiding city development. \"Urbanization and economic development complement and reinforce each other\"; \"urban development is a process where rural populations gather in cities and agricultural land is transformed into construction land in proportion\"; \"urban planning and construction must prioritize historical and cultural preservation, avoid short-termism, and reject large-scale demolition and construction\"; \"city size should match the carrying capacity of local resources and the environment\" - these observations reflect the core of the people-centered urban development vision. A city belongs to its people, and its construction must always adhere to a people-centered approach, with the goal of enhancing the well-being of its residents. At the Central Urbanization Work Conference in December 2013, Xi stated: \"The idea of making life more comfortable for the people must be embedded in every detail of urban planning and construction.\" In November 2020, at a grand gathering celebrating the 30th anniversary of the development and opening-up of Shanghai's Pudong, Xi further emphasized: \"Urban construction must prioritize livability for the people and reserve the best resources for them.\" Improving livability through balanced planning of production, daily life and ecology is one of the \"Five Coordinations\" Xi has outlined for urban development. Creating a quality living environment has always been a central goal in urban work. Having a home is the foundation of livability. While working in Fujian Province, Xi vigorously promoted housing improvement initiatives such as the \"Comfort Housing Project,\" which significantly enhanced urban living conditions. Xi published a signed article in Fujian Daily entitled \"Properly Handling Eight Relationships in Urban Development,\" in which he systematically explained that \"urban construction and renewal is a complex social system project that must be future-oriented while grounded in present needs.\" Improving the livability of urban development requires not only ensuring adequate housing, but also pursuing ecological livability. Recently, Baiyangdian Lake in Xiong'an New Area, North China's Hebei Province, saw the discovery of a new bird species, the Eastern crowned warbler. As of May 2024, the number of wild bird species in the area had increased to 296 - 90 more than before the New Area was established. In January 2019, while visiting the Xiong'an planning exhibition center, Xi remarked that \"the site was chosen specifically to protect Baiyangdian, not harm it. The city and the lake should complement and enhance each other.\" With boats gliding across the lake and people strolling through the scenery, the balanced harmony between the new city and the wetlands reflects a model of coexistence between humanity and nature. \"In the past, cities were preoccupied with building roads, bridges, tunnels and transportation infrastructure. Today, every city is prioritizing ecological restoration and green development - this is a welcome shift.\" \"Coordinate space, scale and industrial structure to enhance the overall effectiveness of urban work\"; \"coordinate planning, construction and management to improve systemic governance\"; \"coordinate reform, technology and culture to ensure sustainable development;\" \"coordinate production, life and ecology to enhance urban livability\"; \"coordinate efforts from government, society and citizens to boost participation\" - the \"Five Coordinations\" reflect both epistemological insight and methodological guidance. They show a profound understanding of the laws of urban development and a clear people-centered value orientation: \"To do a good job in urban work, we must respond to new trends, new demands and new expectations. We must uphold a people-centered development philosophy and ensure cities are built for the people. This is the starting point and ultimate goal of our work in cities.\" Embarking on a sound path of urban development We should \"improve the level of new-type urbanization and chart a path for urban development with Chinese characteristics.\" Urbanization is the path toward modernization. To achieve urbanization in a developing country like ours, with a population of more than 1.4 billion, is \"unprecedented in human history.\" Our national conditions - a large urban population and strong resource constraints - determine that we cannot follow the old path of Western urban development. At the Central Urban Work Conference held in December 2015, Xi creatively proposed improving the level of new-type urbanization and charting a path for urban development with Chinese characteristics. What is a path for urban development with Chinese characteristics? Its essence lies in the concept of a people-centered city. Basic public services are closely related to the interests of the people. To chart a sound path for urban development with Chinese characteristics and promote the building of a people-centered city, we must focus on solving the most pressing, immediate and practical issues that concern the people as well as continuously improve the equalization and quality of public services. To promote the equalization of basic public services, how should some fundamental relationships be handled? Xi's concept of a people-centered city provides a \"key\" that contains scientific dialectics. For example, regarding the relationship between large cities and small- to medium-sized cities, he pointed out the need to strengthen connectivity between megacities and small-sized and medium-sized cities. \"We should also promote equitable access to basic public services in small- and medium-sized cities - particularly in education and healthcare - and make small and medium-sized cities more attractive to people,\" said Xi. In recent years, jointly with Beijing and Tianjin, Hebei Province has established multiple regional medical centers operated at the national level, allowing the public to enjoy consultations with experts from the two cities at their doorsteps. More than 300 primary and secondary schools from Beijing and Tianjin have cooperated in schooling with Hebei, expanding access to quality educational resources... Basic public services have become more equal and more accessible, providing solid support for coordinated regional development. Another example is the relationship between local residents and migrant populations. Solving people-related issues is the key to promoting new-type urbanization. To enable migrant workers to win urbanite status and to strive to enhance the quality and ability of migrant workers' integration into cities are tasks that must be addressed in our promotion of urbanization. \"A city should not only have high-rise buildings, and it must also show enough concern for how people can lead a better life. Socialism with Chinese characteristics is about achieving common prosperity.\" The general secretary earnestly said, \"It is a must to act on the principle that a city should be built by the people and for the people, continuously meet residents' diversified and varied needs for housing, and ensure that migrant workers can come and stay here, enjoy a secure life and have their own careers.\" Grasping the priorities of urban governance \"In urban governance, we must focus on urban management and services, continuously improving both.\" Urban work is complex and multifaceted; it is a systematic project. Providing meticulous urban management and good public services for the people is at the core of urban work. Xi has repeatedly stated that when assessing a city, the first aspect to consider is its urban plan. A scientific plan yields the greatest benefit, while planning errors result in the biggest waste, and frequent plan changes are the greatest taboo. Nowadays, the world is changing rapidly, both above and below ground. A forest three kilometers away, a woodland one kilometer away, and a park just 300 meters away are gradually becoming a reality. Facilities such as the \"15-minute living circle,\" community canteens, and smart elderly care stations are being developed to benefit the public. Starting from a \"blank slate,\" the \"City of the Future\" is growing and evolving. During his time working in Fuzhou, Xi presided over \"Fuzhou City's 20-Year Economic and Social Development Strategic Vision,\" which systematically planned the goals, steps, layout and key points of the three-year, eight-year and 20-year economic and social development of Fuzhou, bringing significant changes to the city. In the preface, Xi wrote, \"Today, we stand at the source of creating the future.\" Xi said we should enhance precision and effectiveness in governance with meticulous care, patience and ingenuity, much like doing embroidery. Xi's metaphor of \"embroidery\" embodies a scientific methodology that emphasizes comprehensive consideration and systematic policy implementation. Meticulous governance needs to begin with practical matters related to homes and the small issues in our daily lives, effectively bridging the \"last mile\" in serving the community. Grassroots affairs are quite complex; how can we achieve tangible results through meticulous efforts? Xi provides an answer: \"Urban governments should shift from being 'rowers' to 'helmsmen,' managing urban affairs and shouldering social responsibilities together with the market, enterprises and citizens.\" \"We need to stimulate the vitality of the entire society, involving the public in discussions about their own matters and encouraging everyone to participate in collective issues.\" He also emphasizes \"integrating whole-process people's democracy into the modernization of urban governance.\" In Beijing, innovative practices such as \"immediate response to complaints\" have been explored, with the government service hotline \"12345\" utilizing last year's demand big data to identify the most pressing pain points in people's livelihoods and governance bottlenecks. In Shenzhen, Longhua District has established \"neighborhood discussion halls\" and organized \"tea gatherings\" to address public demands and opinions. What kind of support does intelligence offer? Strengthening digital empowerment. Chongqing, as the city with the largest jurisdiction area and population in China, encompasses a large metropolis, vast rural areas, extensive mountainous regions and significant reservoir areas. Its vast and complex operational system tests the level of modern governance. In April 2024, Xi visited Chongqing's \"city brain\" at the city's digital urban operation and governance center. Here, various urban indicators such as water, electricity, bridges, tunnels, railways and pipelines are all connected, enabling intelligent perception of urban operational risks and assisting in urban management decision-making. Inheriting the soul of urban culture \"People should cherish historical and cultural heritage as treasuring their own lives.\" In ancient times, people said, \"All things have different characteristics, but they all know how to protect their roots.\" \"History and culture are the soul of a city and people should cherish historical and cultural heritage as treasuring their own lives.\" Protecting the city's cultural heritage and preserving Chinese cultural genes are of great importance to Xi. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a high level of enthusiasm for urban \"development\" and \"demolition and reconstruction\" in Fuzhou, a city located on the southeast coast. The former residence of Lin Juemin, a renowned revolutionary hero, in Sanfangqixiang (Three Lanes and Seven Alleys), an ancient block in downtown Fuzhou, was due to be razed to the ground to give way to a development project. At this crucial moment, a member of the Fuzhou municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference wrote a letter to Xi, then the new Party chief of Fuzhou. Upon hearing the news, Xi immediately moved to postpone the demolition. \"We must protect, repair and make good use of the city's cultural relics in our hands. Not only should we prevent them from being damaged, but also help them flourish and pass them on to future generations.\" Xi's remarks at a meeting on cultural relics protection were awakening. After 30 years, Sanfangqixiang once again welcomed its old friend who cherishes it. In 2021, Xi took a walk and inspected the Nanhou Street and Langguan Alley, and visited the former residence of scholar Yan Fu, stressing the importance of cherishing ancient buildings, old houses and old blocks as well as treating them with respect. New and old, demolition and reservation, all test historical foresight. From Guangzhou's Yongqingfang to Shanghai's Huangpu River, from Chaozhou Ancient City to Pingyao Old Street, Xi's important speeches have pointed out the direction and put forward requirements for the continuation of the historical heritage of cities. A nation needs a national spirit, and a city also needs an urban spirit. Today, 767,000 immovable cultural relics, 143 national historical and cultural cities, nearly 800 Chinese historical and cultural towns and villages, nearly 1,300 historical and cultural blocks, and 68,000 historical buildings constitute a rich carrier for inheriting China's excellent traditional culture, allowing cities to retain memories and people to remember their homesickness.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-07-16 00:49:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "video_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_priority": 1333464, "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/en_prnasisa.png", "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top"], "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "992f9c0cbf7b6fd4f7606fc4c52640a8", "title": "NetGain Systems Launches Astra AI, the World's First Large Language Model Purpose-Built for IT Asset Observability and Management", "link": "https://en.prnasia.com/story/496646-0.shtml", "keywords": ["ite", "tls", "pdt", "afi"], "creator": null, "description": "Astra evolves how enterprises anticipate and resolve IT issues before they disrupt businesses and their complex digital infrastructures. Key Highlights NetGain Systems has launched Astra AI, the first Large Language Model (LLM) purpose-built for IT observability, delivering automation, anomaly detection, and predictive insights across complex digital infrastructure. Astra AI is starting with 500TB of domain-specific data from more than 20 years of enterprise IT environments New LLM addresses a fast-growing USD $4.1B observability market by helping enterprises detect and resolve infrastructure issues proactively Astra AI supports CIOs with intelligent, real-time insights while aligning with Singapore's Smart Nation and AI goals launched in November 2024. Inspired by the Southeast Asia-focused LLM initiative, NetGain shares its vision and is actively looking to contribute to advancing sovereign AI through enterprise-grade innovation. SINGAPORE, July 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- NetGain Systems, a leading Singapore-based innovator in IT observability, has announced the release of Astra AI, the first-ever Large Language Model (LLM) specifically trained to enhance IT asset visibility and proactive infrastructure management. Built on more than 20 years of operational expertise, Astra AI delivers a new level of automation, context awareness, and performance insight for enterprise IT teams. NetGain Systems Astra AI Dashboard Unlike general-purpose LLMs, Astra AI is engineered specifically for IT environments. It applies deep contextual learning to help operations teams detect anomalies, trace dependencies, and optimise system performance. Based on the LLama 4 architecture and fine-tuned in-house by NetGain Systems, Astra AI supports predictive analytics, real-time issue triage, and intelligent forecasting. According to MarketsandMarkets, the global observability tools market is expected to grow from USD $2.4 billion in 2023 to USD $4.1 billion by 2028, reflecting the increasing importance of intelligent monitoring. In Southeast Asia, digital transformation is accelerating. Business outages in the region cost an average of USD $2.5 million per hour \u2013 well above the global norm \u2013 highlighting the urgent need for proactive, AI-enabled observability tools. \"Astra AI goes beyond conventional AI tools. It is a purpose-built system engineered to understand IT infrastructure with the depth and precision of a seasoned systems architect,\" said Toh Soon Seah, CTO and Founder of NetGain Systems. \"It can trace dependencies, recognise system behaviours, anticipate failures, and provide actionable recommendations while ensuring that all client data remains private and secure.\" Astra AI processes structured and unstructured data including logs, metrics, configurations, and traces. It generates natural language responses tailored to enterprise-scale queries. Rather than relying on fixed alert thresholds, Astra AI continuously analyses environmental context to detect early signs of infrastructure stress or failure. Organisations can deploy Astra AI on premise for high-security requirements or in the cloud for scalability. The system is designed for speed and efficiency, delivering most analytical responses within 1\u20133 seconds. Even complex summaries across large datasets complete within minutes, maintaining usability across a wide range of enterprise applications. \"Astra AI has significantly enhanced our operational capabilities,\" said Leo Tan, CTO of Trident Digital Tech Holdings. \"This is what domain-specialised AI looks like in practice. It understands IT telemetry and infrastructure with the depth and intuition of a seasoned engineer. Astra AI's real-time analytics and insights enable more effective monitoring and management of our digital services.\" Astra AI is launched at a time when enterprises face the challenge of managing distributed, hybrid, and fragmented IT systems. This fragmentation complicates visibility, introduces new vulnerabilities, and makes root cause analysis increasingly difficult. As IT ecosystems continue to scale across on-premise, private cloud, and multi-cloud environments, IT operations teams are often overwhelmed by siloed alerts, inconsistent data formats, and a growing skills gap. They are in a reactive position that limits their ability to drive their businesses forward. Astra AI's deep contextual understanding helps bridge these silos by providing unified intelligence that correlates signals across the full IT stack. It empowers teams to move beyond reactive monitoring, shifting toward proactive management and continuous optimisation. By embedding this intelligence into everyday IT operations, Astra AI prevents downtime while strengthening overall system resilience and agility. Traditional monitoring tools lack the flexibility and intelligence to adapt to these dynamic environments. Astra AI's contextual learning engine fills this gap by delivering operational clarity and proactive risk mitigation, preventing disruption to businesses. NetGain Systems's product and technology development strategy aligns with Singapore's Smart Nation and AI goals. Astra AI was inspired by the government's Southeast Asia-focused LLM initiative and shares its vision to build sovereign, locally relevant AI that advances enterprise resilience. \"This launch reinforces Singapore's potential to lead in applied AI for enterprise infrastructure,\" said Toh. \"We built Astra AI to be the foundation for the next generation of AI-driven operations. It was designed here, for this region and globally, to meet the performance, security, and compliance needs of enterprises.\" NetGain Systems is actively engaging CIOs, technology executives, and managed service providers to participate in early-access pilots of Astra AI. Demonstrations will be tailored to each organisation's infrastructure and strategic goals. Please visit http://netgain-systems.com for more information.

difficulties and data quality remain significant hurdles for organisations looking to leverage AI across transportation management SYDNEY, July 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Manhattan Associates Inc. (NASDAQ: MANH), the global leader in supply chain commerce, today announced the findings of its latest collaboration with international research firm Vanson Bourne. The global research surveyed 1,450 senior decision-makers* from organisations in manufacturing, retail, wholesale, consumer goods, grocery and food & beverage sectors, across North America, Latin America, Europe and Australia. \"Transportation is the backbone of supply chains, essential to ensuring goods are delivered on time to meet customer expectations,\" commented Bryant Smith, director, Transportation Management Systems (TMS) at Manhattan Associates. \"Yet, managing transportation is becoming increasingly complex, pressured by demands on shorter fulfilment times, capacity and cost efficiencies, tighter sustainability regulations, and the growing necessity for access to end-to-end visibility across all operations,\" Smith added. Fragmented systems: operational visibility and efficiency still challenging The true value of visibility extends beyond simply accessing operational data: it lies in the ability to address issues highlighted by this information and action operational improvements more quickly and efficiently. Beyond disruptions however, 60% of organisations say that enhancing visibility leads to greater customer satisfaction, through more accurate and timely updates, while 50% cite reductions in transportation costs as a key benefit of increased operational visibility. The AI revolution: excitement but readiness challenges 61% of organisations anticipate fully autonomous Agentic AI, capable of acting independently to achieve specific goals within the next five years, however, only 37% have deeply integrated AI and machine learning in their TMS today. While many might view five years in the AI space like an eon, the gap between future expectations and current usage is noteworthy given adoption is rarely straightforward: although almost half (48%) said that they already feel very prepared for autonomous agents by 2030, practically every organisation (99%) reported facing, or expecting to face, hurdles, with concerns including skill shortages (49%), integration difficulties (44%) and data quality and availability issues (44%). With many organisations seemingly well-placed to take advantage of the cost, efficiency and scalability gains afforded by autonomous agents, those organisations on the other side need to rethink their AI strategies otherwise they risk losing significant (and possibly irretrievable) market share to rivals. Sustainability compliance: a priority and significant pain point The push for more sustainable transportation is widespread. 69% of organisations say sustainability is either a global mandate or an area of significant pressure, with 62% already implementing Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive reporting. Navigating complex and shifting compliance requirements remains a global challenge, with sustainability compliance most frequently cited as a constraint expected to impact organisational performance over the next five years. A modern TMS can help to deliver the data visibility and functionality needed to measure progress and demonstrate compliance, vital to ensuring sustainability remains at the forefront of organisational thinking. Smith summarised: \"Modern transportation management demands organisations balance a range of competing priorities, and the research clearly illustrates many organisations are still unprepared to meet the challenges of evolving sustainability mandates, expectations around AI and the need for more visible, actionable data insights. Looking ahead to 2030, these demands will intensify, increasing the pressure on organisations to operate transportation operations in smarter more intuitive ways. \"87% of respondents anticipate that challenges in areas such as operational visibility, AI adoption and sustainability compliance will intensify, leaving their current Transportation Management Systems struggling to keep pace. Failure to act now will expose organisations to rising costs, questions over long-term efficacy, and the risk of falling short of customer promises,\" Smith concluded. ENDS Additional stats: 48% of organisations spend more than 10% of their transportation logistics budget on errors and disruptions 78% view transportation management as a strategic imperative for success and this figure rises to 86% by 2030 61% are anticipating fully autonomous Agentic AI, capable of acting independently to achieve specific goals, or minimal human oversight within the next five years for TMS 50% report challenges in proactively rerouting shipments, while 49% struggle with optimising dock and warehouse labor scheduling 82% express strong confidence that advances in planning, forecasting and modelling will reduce freight costs by at least 5% within the next five years. Organisations are still struggling to operationalise sustainability: only 34% say they've factored sustainability into operational planning, 30% into procurement decisions, and just 31% offer carbon-friendly fuel solutions. While a majority have integrated their TMS with Sales and Operations Planning systems (60%) and are utilising predictive analytics or AI (56%), far fewer are capitalising on key enablers such as historical trend analysis (38%), automated booking and tendering (36%), or real-time demand sensing (35%). *Methodology: Vanson Bourne surveyed 1,450 senior decision makers with responsibility for or knowledge of their organisation's transportation management operations, working within transportation, logistics, supply chain, IT or finance functions. Respondents must operate within the manufacturing, retail, wholesale, consumer goods, grocery and food & beverage sectors. The survey interviewed respondents from North America, Latin America, Europe and Australia. All respondents came from organisations with at least US$750 million in global annual revenue.
