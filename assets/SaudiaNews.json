UTM's Open and Distance Learning (ODL) connects students globally via innovative digital platforms, facilitating global knowledge exchange and academic excellence. The initiative started in 2020, with the offering of 3 programs which now has expanded to 12 programs including the first of its kind in Malaysia, the Doctor of Professional Practice. Today, the ODL program has enrolled 1,010 students across 22 countries, with 285 graduates. In addition to Malaysia, students come from Canada, the United Kingdom (UK), Belgium, Egypt, Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria, Liberia, Iran, China, South Korea, India, and Bangladesh. According to UTM Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Dr. Mohd Shafry Mohd Rahim, the university remains committed to making education inclusive, flexible, and forward-thinking. \"While we hope that our students will be able to study independently using the self-instructional materials, we strive to maintain a personal touch with our students. Each program will be assigned a course coordinator who will be responsible for addressing any queries from students. Additionally, each student will have the opportunity to attend up to six personal synchronous sessions with their lecturer. We believe that, through this approach, we can establish a closer relationship between students and lecturers, which makes our program unique.\" Additionally, UTM has introduced a web-based virtual reality lab that significantly enhances learning experiences, particularly in engineering, science, and technology fields. \"At UTM, we believe that physical boundaries should not limit education. Our Open and Distance Learning (ODL) programs provide opportunities for learners worldwide to achieve academic excellence using cutting-edge digital platforms and innovative teaching methodologies. Integrating our Virtual Reality Lab and Recognised Research Supervision (UKCGE) further ensures that our postgraduate students receive the same high-quality education as those attending on-campus programs.\" he added. Beyond full-degree programs, UTM's ODL framework also includes micro-credential courses, which allow professionals to upskill and re-skill in specialised areas aligned with industry demands. These short-term, modular courses provide flexibility for learners who wish to enhance their expertise without committing to a complete postgraduate program. By integrating micro-credentials with graduate ODL programs, UTM promotes lifelong learning, progressively allowing individuals to develop their skills through stackable credentials. This initiative aligns with Malaysia's vision for a knowledge-driven economy, ensuring that education remains industry-relevant, accessible, and globally competitive. UTM has also achieved the highest ranking in Malaysia for graduate employability, reinforcing the university's strong industry connections and career-focused curriculum. The university's emphasis on technological integration, quality research, and global recognition makes its ODL programs highly attractive to students and employers. With a growing global student base and the rising demand for online postgraduate education, UTM remains progressive in digital higher education innovation. The introduction of the virtual reality lab and recognised research supervision ensures that remote learners receive an engaging and practical academic experience comparable to on-campus studies.
