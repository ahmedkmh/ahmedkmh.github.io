YORK, Dec. 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Lumary, an innovator in smart lighting and smart home technology, will make its in-person debut at CES 2025, showcasing its creative products: the Permanent Outdoor Light Max, UFO High Bay Light, and the Next-Generation 4-Zone Solar Watering Timer. These industry-first products, developed based on market demand forecasts, mark Lumary's entry into various segments of the smart home industry. During the event, Lumary will exhibit at the Lumary CES Experience Center, located at Booth #40548 in the South Hall 3. Lumary CES 2025 The Redesigned Permanent Outdoor Light Max Simplifies Installation and Enhances Nighttime Illumination. Following the success of Lumary's first-generation permanent outdoor light on Amazon in 2023, Lumary developed the new permanent outdoor light max based on user feedback. The latest model features a split design, innovatively separating the base from the light body. Installation is as simple as securing the base under the eaves and sliding the light body into place. Additionally, the LED beads have been upgraded, with reduced spacing between them, resulting in significantly increased brightness and a more vibrant decorative ambiance at night. Industry-First Smart UFO High Bay Light: Simplifying Complex Wiring and Enabling Group Control for Workspaces Lumary introduces the concept of smart lighting to traditional UFO high bay light, addressing the challenges of complex wiring and lack of centralized control in workspaces like garages, workshops, warehouses, and barns. With the Lumary App and remote control, users can easily configure and flexibly group lights, allowing groupings to be customized, split, or reorganized based on different task requirements. Equipped with a three-level motion sensor, the product enhances workspace safety while optimizing energy and time savings. The sensor detects motion up to 60 feet away, eliminating the need for manual switches, and offers adjustable illumination times ranging from 5 seconds to 60 minutes. Industry-First Four-Zone Solar-Powered Smart Watering Timer: Revolutionizing Home Garden Watering Following the launch of its first battery-powered smart irrigation system in April 2024, Lumary has further enhanced the user experience with the introduction of a Wi-Fi direct connection version, eliminating the need for a Bluetooth gateway. The new Wi-Fi module features low-power design, with energy consumption as low as 400\u03bcA/h. The system is equipped with an adjustable solar panel and two 4V 550F super capacitors, significantly extending its battery life (with a lifespan of up to 50,000 hours). Additionally, a highly requested water usage monitoring feature has been added, offering more intelligent management for home garden irrigation. CES Showcase At Lumary's booth (#40548), CES attendees will have the opportunity to experience the latest smart lighting and smart home products from Lumary. They will also have the chance to engage with Lumary's team to discuss how the brand has evolved to meet the growing demands of smart living enthusiasts.

(\"JinkoSolar\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: JKS), one of the largest and most innovative solar module manufacturers in the world, today announced that it has been recognized with two prestigious awards from EUPD Research, the Solar Prosumer and the DACH Energy Transition Award. The Energy Transition Award is a prestigious acknowledgement for the pioneers of the energy transition in the DACH (Germany, Austria and Switzerland), who succeed in comprehensively integrating the new energy world into their product and service portfolio and are seen as role models for others. The SolarProsumer Award honors companies that are active in the photovoltaic industry and are particularly distinguished by innovative business models and solutions in the field of solar energy. The term \"prosumer\" refers to the idea that consumers not only produce energy by installing solar systems, but also become producers themselves and thus participate in the energy market. The Solar Prosumer Award recognizes companies that help promote and implement this idea. \"We are very proud to have been recognized by EUPD Research with two prestigious awards in 2024. The DACH Energy Transition Award recognizes our far-reaching commitment to deliver a one-step solution to end customers and support the energy transition in the EU, and in the DACH region specifically. On the other hand, the SolarProsumer Award is based on the professional opinions and evaluations of PV system owners in Germany. It is therefore the most direct reflection of consumer trust in JinkoSolar, one of the most trusted and admired global PV brands\" says Frank Niendorf, JinkoSolar' EU Vice-President.
