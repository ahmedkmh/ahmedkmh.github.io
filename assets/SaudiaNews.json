This forum marked the inaugural edition for the Africa region, representing a significant milestone in Malaysia's higher education engagement efforts. Moving forward, it was intended to be held once every two years, with each edition hosted on a rotational basis across different African countries to ensure broader regional participation, co-hosting opportunities, and stronger visibility throughout the continent. The event was attended by the Guest of Honour, the Honourable Dato' Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, whose presence coincided with his Africa engagement visit, reflecting Malaysia's strong commitment to South\u2013South cooperation. In conjunction with MAHEF2025\u2013Africa, the Study in Malaysia Education Fair & Counsellor Workshop Kenya 2025 was also held, further strengthening Malaysia's outreach and engagement efforts in the region. Carrying the theme \"Intensifying Internationalisation in the Context of the Global South Agenda,\" the Forum aimed to strengthen higher education cooperation, expand research collaboration, and advance talent mobility across Malaysia and participating African countries. The Malaysian delegation was led by YBhg. Datuk Dr. Anesee bin Ibrahim, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia, accompanied by senior officials including YBhg. Datuk Professor Dr. Azlinda Azman, Director-General of Higher Education, and Novie Tajuddin, Chief Executive Officer of EMGS.

Participants included parents, students, alumni, government officials, university representatives, and quality assurance bodies, collectively underscoring the strong and diverse interest in Malaysia-Africa education cooperation. \"Malaysia and Africa share a history of struggle against colonialism, a spirit of resilience, and a firm belief that education is a vehicle for achieving justice, human dignity, and national progress. Malaysia firmly pledges to strengthen skills and talent exchange, deepen university-to-university collaboration, and promote equitable access to education. Together with our partners in Kenya and across the African continent, we remain committed to advancing our shared aspirations in higher education,\" said YAB Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim, Prime Minister of Malaysia. \"This forum reflects our collective ambition to strengthen South\u2013South cooperation in education and research, leveraging the comparative strengths of our nations to address shared challenges such as climate change, digital transformation, and youth employability,\" said Julius Migos Ogamba, Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Education, Kenya. \"It is our hope that Malaysia and Africa will continue to strengthen this partnership through deeper institutional linkages, expanded scholarship opportunities, co-developed programmes, and collaborative research that addresses regional and global challenges,\" said Datuk Dr. Anesee bin Ibrahim, Secretary-General, Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) Malaysia. Novie Tajuddin, the Chief Executive Officer of EMGS, also add that \"MAHEF2025-Africa is a starting platform to reach out to our seven participating African countries, not only through our physical presence here, but also digitally\". MAHEF2025\u2013Africa served as a strategic platform for bilateral and multilateral collaboration. The Forum facilitated: Strengthening Government-to-Government (G2G) and Government-to-Institution linkages Enhancing University-to-University (U2U) partnerships Advancing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) cooperation Expanding Transnational Education (TNE) initiatives Supporting academic exchanges, joint research, and postgraduate collaboration Promoting student and talent mobility across both regions A key highlight of the event was the signing and exchange of Malaysia\u2013Africa Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs), which reinforced joint aspirations to deepen collaboration in higher education, research, and capacity building.
