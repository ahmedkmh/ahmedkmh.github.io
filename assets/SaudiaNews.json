The pending acquisition will be completed by a newly formed subsidiary Visara, Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of ophthalmic therapeutics for serious eye disorders Appointment of Mr. Kyler Lei as Chief Financial Officer, bringing significant expertise in Hong Kong and global capital markets ROCKVILLE, Md., Oct. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- I-Mab (NASDAQ: IMAB) (I-Mab or the Company), is a global biotechnology platform company committed to accelerating access to innovative medicines for patients worldwide, yesterday announced its new business model, focused on its global capabilities built to accelerate access to innovative medicines and to enable broad strategic growth. The Company announced its intention to pursue a Hong Kong IPO through dual listing on NASDAQ and Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX). The Company intends to operate under the new name of NovaBridge Biosciences. The Company also announced the pending acquisition of VIS-101, a novel bifunctional biologic targeting VEGF-A and ANG2, and a more potent molecule that could potentially provide more durable treatment benefits for patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME) than current standard of care. The pending acquisition will be made by a newly formed subsidiary, Visara, Inc. (Visara), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing ophthalmic therapeutics for serious eye disorders, and is expected to be completed later this month. In addition, the Company reaffirmed its previously announced givastomig investment plans as part of its new strategy. Mr. Kyler Lei has been named Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of I-Mab, bringing significant expertise in the Hong Kong and global capital markets. The Company sees a significant growth potential from the Asia Pacific originated biopharma innovations. Confidence in this opportunity comes from emerging trends showing that the Asia Pacific region has generated more than 30% of global biopharma assets under development, and has achieved more than $80B in deal value through collaborations with leading multi-national pharmaceutical organizations. In addition, the Asia Pacific biopharmaceutical ecosystem has become increasingly agile and efficient, with significantly lower clinical trial costs and faster patient enrollment than the global median, while maintaining high quality standards1. \"We believe we are entering a new era of rapid growth in the global biotech economy, driven by greater innovation capability in China and Asia and a resurgence of investment in high growth international markets across Asia. With our new business model, we are uniquely positioned to strategically create significant value for patients and investors,\" said Mr. Fu Wei, Executive Chairman of I-Mab. \"Through the strategic insight of our expanded Board, backing by CBC Group, Asia's largest dedicated healthcare asset management firm, and our dual listing strategy, I-Mab is ideally placed to partner with leading global innovators to identify and accelerate high-value assets. The proposed dual listing on both NASDAQ and HKEX is a key element of our global growth strategy. This move will enable us to broaden and diversify our investor base, and enhance trading liquidity and access to capital, while strengthening our presence with key stakeholders in the rapidly growing Asian market.\" \"2025 has been a time of significant progress for I-Mab. Presentation of compelling Phase 1b givastomig combination data reinforced our confidence in its potential to be a best-in-class Claudin 18.2-directed therapy for gastric cancer and drove our plans to initiate a global randomized Phase 2 study, expected to begin in Q1 2026. In addition, the Company recently secured additional capital, and has attracted seasoned biotech executives to the Board of Directors and Scientific Advisory Board,\" said Sean Fu, PhD, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of I-Mab. \"With the strong foundation from our work on givastomig, and excellent progress this year, we are optimistic about moving forward with our new strategy. Our new global platform allows us to uphold our commitment to value creation by realizing the full potential of innovative medicines and improving the lives of patients.\" The NovaBridge Business Model and Pipeline The Company intends to partner with leading innovators to identify and accelerate high-value assets. Our model integrates rigorous asset selection, bespoke translational strategies, and efficient clinical execution. With the backing of CBC Group, we leverage deep local insights and global capabilities to develop the most promising drug candidates across a range of therapeutic categories. The Company will utilize a \"hub-and-spoke\" model to create and advance specialized subsidiary companies (spokes) which maintain operational focus and agility. By focusing each spoke on a specific asset or therapeutic area, the Company can optimally manage risk and create value through potential partnering transactions. Pipeline: Givastomig, a potential best-in-class Claudin 18.2 X 4-1BB bispecific antibody, is in Phase 1b clinical trials for the potential treatment of gastric cancer and other Claudin 18.2-positive gastrointestinal malignancies. A global, randomized Phase 2 study is planned, with the enrollment of the first patient targeted in Q1 2026. Givastomig is being jointly developed through a global partnership with ABL Bio, in which I-Mab is the lead party and shares worldwide rights, excluding Greater China and South Korea, equally with ABL Bio. Ragistomig is an anti-PD-L1 X 4-1BB bispecific antibody. Built on Phase 1 clinical data, an ongoing Phase 1b study designed to expand the therapeutic index is expected to yield results in 2H 2026. The program is being jointly developed with ABL Bio. Uliledlimab targets CD73, the rate-limiting enzyme critical for adenosine-driven immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Progression free survival (PFS) data are expected in 2H 2026 from an ongoing randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating uliledlimab + toripalimab compared to pembrolizumab alone or toripalimab alone. I-Mab owns worldwide rights to uliledlimab outside of Greater China. VIS-101, to be acquired by Visara, a newly formed I-Mab subsidiary, under the new business model, is a bifunctional biologic targeting VEGF-A and ANG2, currently in Phase 2 development VIS-101 is a novel bifunctional biologic targeting VEGF-A and ANG-2, and a more potent molecule that could potentially provide more durable treatment benefits for patients with wet AMD, DME, and retinal vein occlusion (RVO) than current standard of care. VIS-101 has completed initial safety and dose-escalation studies in both the US and China, and is currently completing a randomized, dose-ranging Phase 2 study in China. VIS-101 is anticipated to be Phase 3-ready in 2026. Acquisition will be completed by a newly subsidiary, Visara. Visara, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development of best-in-class ophthalmic therapeutics, will be launched with an approximately $37M capital infusion from I-Mab and the contribution of certain rights by AffaMed Therapeutics (HK) Limited. The capital contributions to Visara and its acquisition of VS-101 (collectively, the Transactions) are cross-conditioned, and are expected to close later this month. The Company has also signed a separate termsheet with Everest Medicines (HKEX 1952.HK) to potentially out-license greater China rights for VIS-101 and collaborate on global clinical development. Following completion of the Transactions, I-Mab will be the majority shareholder of Visara, and Visara will control global rights to VS-101. Visara is led by Co-Founder and Executive ChairmanEmmett T. Cunningham, Jr., MD, PhD, MPH. Dr. Cunningham has been a physician, innovator, entrepreneur, and investor for more than 25 years, formerly serving as Senior Managing Director at Blackstone Group L.P. and Managing Director at Clarus Ventures, LLC.

Its guiding spirit - Live Today, Love Tomorrow, Unite Forever - has long symbolized collective unity. In 2025, that spirit was truly tested. Just days before opening, an unexpected fire severely damaged the iconic Orbyz Mainstage, raising serious concerns about whether the event could proceed. With crews already on site and attendees from around the world on the way, the challenge was immense. PIXELSCREEN.eu, Tomorrowland's trusted production company, took the lead in on-site coordination and visual recovery. Backed by INFiLED's technical expertise and other suppliers, the team worked efficiently to minimize visual disruption and preserve the festival's immersive atmosphere. This story is not about one company - it's about what happens when a production community refuses to let the music stop. From emergency reconstruction to visual continuity, and from the Mainstage to other immersive venues, everyone played a part. This is how Tomorrowland 2025 became unity in action. Rebuilding the Heart of the Festival The Orbyz Mainstage at Tomorrowland 2025 was envisioned as a cosmic glacier - towering over 50 m tall and 140 m wide, with glowing surfaces and crystalline forms that defined the festival's visual centerpiece. During a final pyrotechnic rehearsal, flames erupted within the structure. Fortunately, no one was injured, but nearly 75% of the Mainstage was destroyed - yet cancellation was never an option. Organizers released a statement mourning the loss of \"a living, breathing world\" while reaffirming their commitment to press on. PIXELSCREEN.eu immediately coordinated recovery efforts. As CEO Frank Verstraeten later recalled, \"The original Mainstage was destroyed by fire, and we had less than 24 hours to rebuild. This was only possible with equipment that was extremely reliable and could be installed very quickly.\" Within a very tight window, on-site teams reassembled a clean, modern substitute Mainstage - 8 m high and 70 m wide - using nearly 700 LED cabinets. The rebuild required logistical precision and technical flexibility, supported by features such as: Magnesium-alloy frames provide rigidity and stability for precise, repeatable setup. Magnet-assisted assembly enables quick, effortless installation. Positioning pins ensure fast, accurate alignment. Fast-lock system allows one-hand operation for instant locking. AR Series touring carts offer robust storage and transport, in single or double-stack sizes, fitting standard trucks. Tomorrowland 2025 Hundreds of panels went up within hours. The installation, paired with NovaStar's COEX 5G control system, which supports 5G signal transmission, allowed the control crew to adjust visual output to fit the improvised stage layout, keeping everything running smoothly. Though simpler in form, the rebuilt stage still delivered full sensory impact - vibrant screens, synced lighting, and powerful sound - proving Tomorrowland's spirit remained undimmed. Beyond the Mainstage \u2013 Visual Continuity Across the Festival Even as crews worked tirelessly on Orbyz, dozens of stages across the festival continued delivering immersive experiences powered by LED visuals and tight execution. Freedom Stage The Freedom Stage was among the most technically ambitious. Known for its vast enclosed design, the 2025 edition featured the \"Floating Sky\" - a kinetic LED ceiling installation that shifted shape and light above the crowd. Built using INFiLED's lightweight and transparent AMT panels featuring 70% transparency and a triangular module layout, the structure delivered layered visuals while allowing stage lighting, wind, and sound to pass through. The result was a mesmerizing, space-like ambiance that transformed continuously throughout each set. Freedom Stage The Great Library A recently redesigned domed venue, The Great Library used curved LED screens integrated along its arches and backdrop to display animated visuals and live camera feeds. Built with INFiLED's AR panels - capable of \u00b110\u00b0 cabinet curvature - the installation wrapped seamlessly around the dome, creating an intimate and cinematic atmosphere. The Great Library CORE Stage Tucked into Tomorrowland's forested area, the CORE stage returned in 2025 with a distinctive visual identity - a large, split-face screen centerpiece surrounded by natural scenery. The immersive design offered a meditative counterpoint to the adrenaline-fueled main areas. CORE Stage This widespread deployment underscored the role LED visuals played - not as mere decoration, but as a binding agent across Tomorrowland's production fabric. Throughout the weekends, the show never paused - and the visual magic never faded. A Triumph of Unity \"PIXELSCREEN.eu has been exclusively providing all video screens for Tomorrowland for 22 years, non-stop,\" said Frank Verstraeten. Tomorrowland 2025 will be remembered not for the fire, but for how the event came together. In a very short time, engineers, crews, designers, and planners rebuilt what months had built, proving that unity and shared purpose can overcome any disruption. \"Unite Forever\" - that wasn't just words on a screen.
