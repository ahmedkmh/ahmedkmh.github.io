Since its inception in 2010, this list has traced the careers of nearly every major female leader in China's business world over the past decade. Nyx He, Partner of BrainCo, was selected for Fortune Magazine 2024 China Most Powerful Women Future List. This list, launched in 2020, highlights the emerging generation of young female leaders in China who are playing important roles in their organizations, business sector and society. They have the potential to make an even greater impact in the future. This year, the list includes Huawei Vice Chairwoman Meng Wanzhou, Gree Electric Appliances Chairwoman Dong Mingzhu, Shun Tak Group Executive Chairperson Pansy Ho Chiu-king, and Wahaha Group Chairwoman Zong Fuli. These female leaders, whether guiding traditional enterprises through digital and global transformations or leading startups in cutting-edge technology sectors as CEOs or partners, are increasingly vital to their companies' sustained growth. Their outstanding contributions and decisive leadership at crucial moments have driven corporate development, social progress, and inspired more women to reach new heights. Since joining BrainCo, Nyx He has adhered to the company's longstanding philosophy of \"Bringing lab technology into the real world to create real-world impact.\" She has been actively involved in public welfare projects, partnering with regional Disabled Persons' Federations and foundations to conduct charitable activities. These initiatives have broken the monopoly of high-end prosthetics held by foreign companies, enabling Chinese individuals with disabilities to access smart prosthetic limbs at extremely low or even no cost. This year, Zhejiang Provincial Development and Reform Commission, in conjunction with the Zhejiang Disabled Persons' Federation and the Zhejiang Foundation For Disabled Persons, launched the \"Zhejiang Technology Empowerment Project for Disabled Persons\". The initiative aims to provide free Intelligent prosthetics to 1,000 lower limb amputees in Zhejiang Province. Currently, the first and second batches of beneficiaries have embarked on new lives with the help of BrainCo independently developed Intelligent prosthetics. Many people have transitioned from staying home due to mobility challenges to stepping out of their homes, confidently seeking employment, and adopting a more positive attitude toward life. Their lives have been transformed by brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. Now, some have become customer service representatives, others have found jobs as baristas, and some can be self-sufficient by doing farm work. Others are pursuing driver's licenses and vocational training for broader career opportunities, while some have even reignited their passion for racing, an interest they had before their amputations. Technology Advances, Public Welfare Continues. Nyx He's inclusion in the 2024 Most Powerful Women Future List is not only a recognition of her achievements but also an acknowledgment of BrainCo's ongoing efforts in technological innovation and public welfare. Looking ahead, Nyx He and the entire BrainCo team will continue leveraging technology as a driving force, fulfilling social responsibilities, and helping more people embrace better lives.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2024-11-01 08:25:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "source_id": "en_prnasisa", "source_priority": 1333464, "source_name": "Pr Newswire Apac", "source_url": "https://en.prnasia.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/en_prnasisa.png", "language": "english", "country": ["yemen", "afghanistan", "india", "singapore", "saudi arabia", "united arab emirates", "china", "taiwan", "pakistan", "brunei", "syria", "bhutan", "turkey", "armenia", "qatar", "philippines", "hong kong", "romania", "laos", "timor-leste", "bangladesh", "vietnam", "azerbaijan", "uzbekistan", "turkmenistan", "macau", "bahrain", "tajikistan"], "category": ["top"], "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": false}, {"article_id": "4f93ad1fd36afa636fd0b56a9f310723", "title": "'Love is Blind, Habibi' reunion: Are Asma and Khatab still dating?

"description": "BANGKOK, Nov. 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- At a meeting held today, the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI) approved 66.9 billion baht (ca. USD 2 Billion) worth of new investments in electronics manufacturing and data centers, the reconduction of several investment promotion packages, and relief measures for promoted companies affected by recent floods in the country's North and Northeast regions. Thailand BOI Approves $2 Billion in Data Centers and Electronics Investments. The Thailand Board of Investment (BOI), at a meeting today chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Pichai Chunhavajira, approved 66.9 billion baht (ca. USD 2 Billion) worth of new investments in electronics manufacturing and data centers, the reconduction of several investment promotion packages, and relief measures for promoted companies affected by recent floods in the country. \"The continuous flow of new foreign investment in data centers and the electronic supply chain reinforce's Thailand's status as a regional tech hub,\" Mr. Narit Therdsteerasukdi, Secretary General of the BOI, said after the board meeting chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira. Project Approvals Today the Board approved the following projects: Quartz Computing Co. Ltd, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, received approval for a 32.8 billion baht investment to establish a hyperscale data center to be located in Chonburi Province. The project was first announced on 30 September 2024 during the visit to Thailand by a senior Google executive. Digitalland Services (Thailand) Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of GDS IDC Services PTE Ltd., received approval for a 28 billion baht investment to establish a hyperscale data center in Chonburi Province. Cheng Yi Technology (Thailand) Co., Ltd. received approval for a 6.15 billion baht project to produce prepreg and copper clad laminate (CCL), important components used in the production of printed circuit boards (PCB). The factory will be located in TFD Industrial Estate 2, Chachoengsao Province. Extension to End-2025 of 4 Incentive Packages The Board approved the extension by one year to end-2025 of four packages of investment promotion measures that initially required applications for promotion to be submitted by end-2024, namely 1) Retention & Expansion Program; 2) Relocation Program 3) Investment Stimulation Measure for Economic Recovery and 4) Investment Promotion Measure to Upgrade Automotive Industry. Applications filed between January 2023 and September 2024 under these four incentive packages represented a combined investment value of more than 650 billion baht. Some of the measures, all placed under the 5-year investment promotion strategy (2023-2027), were also adjusted to better reflect the current investment situation. As part of the revisions, the minimum actual investment required to apply for benefits under the Investment Stimulation Measure for Economic Recovery has been increased from the original 1 billion baht to not less than 2 billion baht. Flood Relief Measures The board also approved relief measures to help promoted companies that have been affected by the recent floods in Thailand. According to the BOI's initial survey of businesses damaged by the floods in the North and the Northeast regions, at least 6 promoted companies in the agricultural & food and light industries sectors were affected. In order to alleviate the impact and help restore normal operations as soon as possible, the companies will be granted an import duty exemption on machinery they would need to replace equipment damaged by the floods, and a deduction of machinery and raw materials that were damaged or lost.
