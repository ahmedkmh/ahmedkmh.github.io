It\u2019s best enjoyed with a group because co-op games almost always are, but also because there are plenty of relatively quiet moments where it\u2019s basically a chill chat room in space. There are some parts of this ship that need a little TLC, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t nearly always having fun playing it. Even when things seem all but lost and everything\u2019s on fire, you can still pull it out if you and your crew work together, play smart, and get a little lucky. Even though there\u2019s still work to do to get Jump Space shipshape, particularly when it comes to adding more variety to its mission objectives, it\u2019s already proven its concept is a winner.",
