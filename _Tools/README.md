## Tools I Use To Update The News Feed In News Directory
since NewsApi Stopped supporting (making you pay to use it) fetching data using website host (Github pages for example)<br>
i decided to do it manually, by going to the link, copy the json as text and going to the repositorie and change each file (EgyptNews and SaudiaNews) with the new json text<br><br>
But of course that would take a long time, so i made a simple python script that Updates the news feed everytime i run it

# WARNING:
Dont Try merging the 2 files together, the reason i split them into 2 is because when i ran the orignal file, it crashed my PC (and i still dont know why)
